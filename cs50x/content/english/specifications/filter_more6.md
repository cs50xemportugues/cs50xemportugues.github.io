Usage
-----

Your program should behave per the examples below. `INFILE.bmp` is the name of the input image and `OUTFILE.bmp` is the name of the resulting image after a filter has been applied.

```
$ ./filter -g INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp
```
```
$ ./filter -r INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp
```
```
$ ./filter -b INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp
```
```
$ ./filter -e INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp
``` 

Hints
-----

*   The values of a pixelâ€™s `rgbtRed`, `rgbtGreen`, and `rgbtBlue` components are all integers, so be sure to round any floating-point numbers to the nearest integer when assigning them to a pixel value!
