Specification

Alright, the challenge now before you is to implement, in order, `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, and `unload` as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that `TIME IN load`, `TIME IN check`, `TIME IN size`, and `TIME IN unload` are all minimized. To be sure, it’s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed `speller` different values for `dictionary` and for `text`. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem. This problem is your chance to design. Although we invite you to minimize space, your ultimate enemy is time. But before you dive in, some specifications from us.

*   You may not alter `speller.c` or `Makefile`.
*   You may alter `dictionary.c` (and, in fact, must in order to complete the implementations of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, and `unload`), but you may not alter the declarations (i.e., prototypes) of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, or `unload`. You may, though, add new functions and (local or global) variables to `dictionary.c`.
*   You may change the value of `N` in `dictionary.c`, so that your hash table can have more buckets.
*   You may alter `dictionary.h`, but you may not alter the declarations of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, or `unload`.
*   Your implementation of `check` must be case-insensitive. In other words, if `foo` is in dictionary, then `check` should return true given any capitalization thereof; none of `foo`, `foO`, `fOo`, `fOO`, `fOO`, `Foo`, `FoO`, `FOo`, and `FOO` should be considered misspelled.
*   Capitalization aside, your implementation of `check` should only return `true` for words actually in `dictionary`. Beware hard-coding common words (e.g., `the`), lest we pass your implementation a `dictionary` without those same words. Moreover, the only possessives allowed are those actually in `dictionary`. In other words, even if `foo` is in `dictionary`, `check` should return `false` given `foo's` if `foo's` is not also in `dictionary`.
*   You may assume that any `dictionary` passed to your program will be structured exactly like ours, alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with `\n`. You may also assume that `dictionary` will contain at least one word, that no word will be longer than `LENGTH` (a constant defined in `dictionary.h`) characters, that no word will appear more than once, that each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe.
*   You may assume that `check` will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes.
*   Your spell checker may only take `text` and, optionally, `dictionary` as input. Although you might be inclined (particularly if among those more comfortable) to “pre-process” our default dictionary in order to derive an “ideal hash function” for it, you may not save the output of any such pre-processing to disk in order to load it back into memory on subsequent runs of your spell checker in order to gain an advantage.
*   Your spell checker must not leak any memory. Be sure to check for leaks with `valgrind`.
*   **The hash function you write should ultimately be your own, not one you search for online.** There are many ways to implement a hash function beyond using the first character (or characters) of a word. Consider a hash function that uses a sum of ASCII values or the length of a word. A good hash function tends to reduce “collisions” and has a fairly even distribution across hash table “buckets”.

Alright, ready to go?

*   Implement `load`.
*   Implement `hash`.
*   Implement `size`.
*   Implement `check`.
*   Implement `unload`.

<div class="alert" data-alert="danger" role="alert"><p>Though Speller’s walkthrough indicates it is reasonable to use a hash function found online, this video is from an older version of the problem where we allowed this. Per the specification above, the hash function you write should ultimately be your own; you <strong>may not</strong> use a hash function you find online. Be sure to cite any external sources you referenced in writing your hash function.</p></div>
