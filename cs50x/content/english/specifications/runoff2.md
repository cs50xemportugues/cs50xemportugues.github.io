Getting Started
---------------

Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

    $
    

Next execute

    wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/psets/3/runoff.zip
    

in order to download a ZIP called `runoff.zip` into your codespace.

Then execute

    unzip runoff.zip
    

to create a folder called `runoff`. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

    rm runoff.zip
    

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

    cd runoff
    

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

    runoff/ $
    

If all was successful, you should execute

    ls
    

and see a file named `runoff.c`. Executing `code runoff.c` should open the file where you will type your code for this problem set. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!

Understanding
-------------

Let’s take a look at `runoff.c`. We’re defining two constants: `MAX_CANDIDATES` for the maximum number of candidates in the election, and `MAX_VOTERS` for the maximum number of voters in the election.

Next up is a two-dimensional array `preferences`. The array `preferences[i]` will represent all of the preferences for voter number `i`, and the integer `preferences[i][j]` here will store the index of the candidate who is the `j`th preference for voter `i`.

Next up is a `struct` called `candidate`. Every `candidate` has a `string` field for their `name`, and `int` representing the number of `votes` they currently have, and a `bool` value called `eliminated` that indicates whether the candidate has been eliminated from the election. The array `candidates` will keep track of all of the candidates in the election.

The program also has two global variables: `voter_count` and `candidate_count`.

Now onto `main`. Notice that after determining the number of candidates and the number of voters, the main voting loop begins, giving every voter a chance to vote. As the voter enters their preferences, the `vote` function is called to keep track of all of the preferences. If at any point, the ballot is deemed to be invalid, the program exits.

Once all of the votes are in, another loop begins: this one’s going to keep looping through the runoff process of checking for a winner and eliminating the last place candidate until there is a winner.

The first call here is to a function called `tabulate`, which should look at all of the voters’ preferences and compute the current vote totals, by looking at each voter’s top choice candidate who hasn’t yet been eliminated. Next, the `print_winner` function should print out the winner if there is one; if there is, the program is over. But otherwise, the program needs to determine the fewest number of votes anyone still in the election received (via a call to `find_min`). If it turns out that everyone in the election is tied with the same number of votes (as determined by the `is_tie` function), the election is declared a tie; otherwise, the last-place candidate (or candidates) is eliminated from the election via a call to the `eliminate` function.

If you look a bit further down in the file, you’ll see that these functions — `vote`, `tabulate`, `print_winner`, `find_min`, `is_tie`, and `eliminate` — are all left to up to you to complete!
