### Understanding

Theoretically, on input of size _n_, an algorithm with a running time of _n_ is “asymptotically equivalent,” in terms of _O_, to an algorithm with a running time of _2n_. Indeed, when describing the running time of an algorithm, we typically focus on the dominant (i.e., most impactful) term (i.e., _n_ in this case, since _n_ could be much larger than 2). In the real world, though, the fact of the matter is that _2n_ feels twice as slow as _n_.

The challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By “fastest,” though, we’re talking actual “wall-clock,” not asymptotic, time.

In `speller.c`, we’ve put together a program that’s designed to spell-check a file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in a file called `dictionary.c`. (It could just be implemented in `speller.c`, but as programs get more complex, it’s often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in `dictionary.c` itself but in `dictionary.h` instead. That way, both `speller.c` and `dictionary.c` can `#include` the file. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite get around to implementing the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) we leave to you! But first, a tour.

#### `dictionary.h`

Open up `dictionary.h`, and you’ll see some new syntax, including a few lines that mention `DICTIONARY_H`. No need to worry about those, but, if curious, those lines just ensure that, even though `dictionary.c` and `speller.c` (which you’ll see in a moment) `#include` this file, `clang` will only compile it once.

Next notice how we `#include` a file called `stdbool.h`. That’s the file in which `bool` itself is defined. You’ve not needed it before, since the CS50 Library used to `#include` that for you.

Also notice our use of `#define`, a “preprocessor directive” that defines a “constant” called `LENGTH` that has a value of `45`. It’s a constant in the sense that you can’t (accidentally) change it in your own code. In fact, `clang` will replace any mentions of `LENGTH` in your own code with, literally, `45`. In other words, it’s not a variable, just a find-and-replace trick.

Finally, notice the prototypes for five functions: `check`, `hash`, `load`, `size`, and `unload`. Notice how three of those take a pointer as an argument, per the `*`:

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">check</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
    

Recall that `char *` is what we used to call `string`. So those three prototypes are essentially just:

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">check</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    

And `const`, meanwhile, just says that those strings, when passed in as arguments, must remain constant; you won’t be able to change them, accidentally or otherwise!
