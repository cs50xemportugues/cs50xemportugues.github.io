-------------

Implement in your `homepage` directory a website that must:

*   Contain at least four different `.html` pages, at least one of which is `index.html` (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
*   Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`. Using some tag (e.g., `<p>`) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
*   Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See [Bootstrap’s documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/) to get started. In particular, you might find some of [Bootstrap’s components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/) of interest. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"</span> <span class="na">integrity=</span><span class="s">"sha384-TX8t27EcRE3e/ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2"</span> <span class="na">crossorigin=</span><span class="s">"anonymous"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"</span> <span class="na">integrity=</span><span class="s">"sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj"</span> <span class="na">crossorigin=</span><span class="s">"anonymous"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"</span> <span class="na">integrity=</span><span class="s">"sha384-ho+j7jyWK8fNQe+A12Hb8AhRq26LrZ/JpcUGGOn+Y7RsweNrtN/tE3MoK7ZeZDyx"</span> <span class="na">crossorigin=</span><span class="s">"anonymous"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> in your pages’ `<head>`, below which you can also include <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"styles.css"</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
      
    
    to link your own CSS.
    
*   Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, `styles.css`, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (`example`), class (`.example`), or ID (`#example`)), and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as `font-size`, or `margin`; and
*   Integrate one or more features of JavaScript into your site to make your site more interactive. For example, you can use JavaScript to add alerts, to have an effect at a recurring interval, or to add interactivity to buttons, dropdowns, or forms. Feel free to be creative!
*   Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.
