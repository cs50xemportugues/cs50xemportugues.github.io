DNA
===

Implement a program that identifies a person based on their DNA, per the below.

    $ python dna.py databases/large.csv sequences/5.txt
    Lavender
    

Getting Started
---------------

Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

    $
    

Next execute

    wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/psets/6/dna.zip
    

in order to download a ZIP called `dna.zip` into your codespace.

Then execute

    unzip dna.zip
    

to create a folder called `dna`. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

    rm dna.zip
    

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

    cd dna
    

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

    dna/ $
    

Execute `ls` by itself, and you should see a few files and folders:

    databases/ dna.py sequences/
    

If you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!
