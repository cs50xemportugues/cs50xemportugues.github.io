### Hints

- If you want to repeatedly re-prompt the user for the value of a variable until some condition is met, you might want to use a `do ... while` loop. For example, recall the following code from lecture, which prompts the user repeatedly until they enter a positive integer. <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Positive Integer: "</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
  </code></pre></div> </div>
  How might you adapt this code to ensure a start size of at least 9, and an end size of at least the start size?

* To declare a new variable, be sure to specify its data type, a name for the variable, and (optionally) what its initial value should be.
  - For example, you might want to create a variable to keep track of how many years have passed.
* To calculate how many years it will take for the population to reach the end size, another loop might be helpful! Inside the loop, youâ€™ll likely want to update the population size according to the formula in the Background, and update the number of years that have passed.
* To print an integer `n` to the terminal, recall that you can use a line of code like <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is %i</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">);</span>
  </code></pre></div> </div>
  to specify that the variable `n` should fill in for the placeholder `%i`.

### How to Test Your Code

Your program should behave per these examples below.

    $ ./population
    Start size: 1200
    End size: 1300
    Years: 1


    $ ./population
    Start size: -5
    Start size: 3
    Start size: 9
    End size: 5
    End size: 18
    Years: 8


    $ ./population
    Start size: 20
    End size: 1
    End size: 10
    End size: 100
    Years: 20


    $ ./population
    Start size: 100
    End size: 1000000
    Years: 115
