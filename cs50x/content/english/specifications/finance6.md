### `index`

Complete the implementation of `index` in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user’s current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks’ total value plus cash).

- Odds are you’ll want to execute multiple `SELECT`s. Depending on how you implement your table(s), you might find [GROUP BY](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+GROUP+BY,) [HAVING](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+HAVING,) [SUM](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+SUM,) and/or [WHERE](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+WHERE) of interest.
- Odds are you’ll want to call `lookup` for each stock.

### `sell`

Complete the implementation of `sell` in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).

- Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a `select` menu whose `name` is `symbol`. Render an apology if the user fails to select a stock or if (somehow, once submitted) the user does not own any shares of that stock.
- Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `shares`. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer or if the user does not own that many shares of the stock.
- Submit the user’s input via `POST` to `/sell`.
- Upon completion, redirect the user to the home page.
- You don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).

### `history`

Complete the implementation of `history` in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.

- For each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock’s symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.
- You might need to alter the table you created for `buy` or supplement it with an additional table. Try to minimize redundancies.

### personal touch

Implement at least one personal touch of your choice:

- Allow users to change their passwords.
- Allow users to add additional cash to their account.
- Allow users to buy more shares or sell shares of stocks they already own via `index` itself, without having to type stocks’ symbols manually.
- Require users’ passwords to have some number of letters, numbers, and/or symbols.
- Implement some other feature of comparable scope.
