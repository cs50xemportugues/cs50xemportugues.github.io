## Implementation Details

Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.

- When the `/` route is requested via `GET`, your web application should display, in a table, all of the people in your database along with their birthdays.
  - First, in `app.py`, add logic in your `GET` request handling to query the `birthdays.db` database for all birthdays. Pass all of that data to your `index.html` template.
  - Then, in `index.html`, add logic to render each birthday as a row in the table. Each row should have two columns: one column for the person’s name and another column for the person’s birthday.
- When the `/` route is requested via `POST`, your web application should add a new birthday to your database and then re-render the index page.
  - First, in `index.html`, add an HTML form. The form should let users type in a name, a birthday month, and a birthday day. Be sure the form submits to `/` (its “action”) with a method of `post`.
  - Then, in `app.py`, add logic in your `POST` request handling to `INSERT` a new row into the `birthdays` table based on the data supplied by the user.

Optionally, you may also:

- Add the ability to delete and/or edit birthday entries.
- Add any additional features of your choosing!

### Hints

- Recall that you can call `db.execute` to execute SQL queries within `app.py`.
  - If you call `db.execute` to run a `SELECT` query, recall that the function will return to you a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one row returned by your query.
- You’ll likely find it helpful to pass in additional data to `render_template()` in your `index` function so that access birthday data inside of your `index.html` template.
- Recall that the `tr` tag can be used to create a table row and the `td` tag can be used to create a table data cell.
- Recall that, with Jinja, you can create a [`for` loop](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#for) inside your `index.html` file.
- In `app.py`, you can obtain the data `POST`ed by the user’s form submission via `request.form.get(field)` where `field` is a string representing the `name` attribute of an `input` from your form.
  - For example, if in `index.html`, you had an `<input name="foo" type="text">`, you could use `request.form.get("foo")` in `app.py` to extract the user’s input.

### Testing

No `check50` for this lab! But be sure to test your web application by adding some birthdays and ensuring that the data appears in your table as expected.

Run `flask run` in your terminal while in your `birthdays` directory to start a web server that serves your Flask application.
