Testing
-------

Be sure to test your code to make sure it handlesâ€¦

*   An election with any number of candidate (up to the `MAX` of `9`)
*   Voting for a candidate by name
*   Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot
*   Printing the winner of the election if there is only one
*   Not eliminating anyone in the case of a tie between all remaining candidates

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`. But be sure to compile and test it yourself as well!
