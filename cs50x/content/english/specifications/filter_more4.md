Getting Started
---------------

Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

    $
    

Next execute

    wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/psets/4/filter-more.zip
    

in order to download a ZIP called `filter-more.zip` into your codespace.

Then execute

    unzip filter-more.zip
    

to create a folder called `filter-more`. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

    rm filter-more.zip
    

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

    cd filter-more
    

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

    filter-more/ $
    

Execute `ls` by itself, and you should see a few files: `bmp.h`, `filter.c`, `helpers.h`, `helpers.c`, and `Makefile`. You should also see a folder called `images` with four BMP files. If you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!

Understanding
-------------

Let’s now take a look at some of the files provided to you as distribution code to get an understanding for what’s inside of them.

### `bmp.h`

Open up `bmp.h` (as by double-clicking on it in the file browser) and have a look.

You’ll see definitions of the headers we’ve mentioned (`BITMAPINFOHEADER` and `BITMAPFILEHEADER`). In addition, that file defines `BYTE`, `DWORD`, `LONG`, and `WORD`, data types normally found in the world of Windows programming. Notice how they’re just aliases for primitives with which you are (hopefully) already familiar. It appears that `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` make use of these types.

Perhaps most importantly for you, this file also defines a `struct` called `RGBTRIPLE` that, quite simply, “encapsulates” three bytes: one blue, one green, and one red (the order, recall, in which we expect to find RGB triples actually on disk).

Why are these `struct`s useful? Well, recall that a file is just a sequence of bytes (or, ultimately, bits) on disk. But those bytes are generally ordered in such a way that the first few represent something, the next few represent something else, and so on. “File formats” exist because the world has standardized what bytes mean what. Now, we could just read a file from disk into RAM as one big array of bytes. And we could just remember that the byte at `array[i]` represents one thing, while the byte at `array[j]` represents another. But why not give some of those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily? That’s precisely what the structs in `bmp.h` allow us to do. Rather than think of some file as one long sequence of bytes, we can instead think of it as a sequence of `struct`s.

### `filter.c`

Now, let’s open up `filter.c`. This file has been written already for you, but there are a couple important points worth noting here.

First, notice the definition of `filters` on line 10. That string tells the program what the allowable command-line arguments to the program are: `b`, `e`, `g`, and `r`. Each of them specifies a different filter that we might apply to our images: blur, edge detection, grayscale, and reflection.

The next several lines open up an image file, make sure it’s indeed a BMP file, and read all of the pixel information into a 2D array called `image`.

Scroll down to the `switch` statement that begins on line 101. Notice that, depending on what `filter` we’ve chosen, a different function is called: if the user chooses filter `b`, the program calls the `blur` function; if `e`, then `edges` is called; if `g`, then `grayscale` is called; and if `r`, then `reflect` is called. Notice, too, that each of these functions take as arguments the height of the image, the width of the image, and the 2D array of pixels.

These are the functions you’ll (soon!) implement. As you might imagine, the goal is for each of these functions to edit the 2D array of pixels in such a way that the desired filter is applied to the image.

The remaining lines of the program take the resulting `image` and write them out to a new image file.
