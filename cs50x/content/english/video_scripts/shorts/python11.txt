So if you haven't noticed by now, good style is really, really important in Python. We don't have curly braces anymore which is great, but we still need to be able to then indicate when a-- how an if block is delimited. In C, we had an open curly brace, then we had some code, we had some closed curly brace. And it didn't really matter how things were styled in between. I mean it mattered for somebody who is reading your code, but it doesn't matter to the computer. It does matter in Python. Tabs and indentation are key in order to indicate what you intend for it to do. So if I had an if block and I put a colon at the end of it and I didn't indent the next line in, Python wouldn't know that that line is supposed to be subject to that if condition. So if you have not yet been in the habit of practicing good coding style, now is the time to definitely reacquaint yourself with the CS50 style guide, because if your code in Python is poorly styled, it's probably not going to work. Sorry about that.
