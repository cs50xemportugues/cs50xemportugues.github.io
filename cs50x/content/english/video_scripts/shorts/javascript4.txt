What if I want to concatenate information? So remember, we can tie different strings together. We could do that in Python. We can do it as well here in JavaScript. And we do that by using plus. So if I want to console dot log a bunch of different strings concatenated together, I just use plus to do it. But here's a little bit of a catch, right? If I'm using plus, now it means two different things. I want to concatenate strings together, but maybe here, I want to add. I really encourage you to take a look at what happens if you write the week array into some JavaScript, and then have a loop that iterates across and console dot logs this. You might find that you get something that you don't expect. And so, JavaScript is making its best guess, and it's assuming that day and 1 are both strings, when really, what I want to do is add them together, literally, because they're numbers. But fortunately JavaScript gives us a way around that by using a function called parse int. Now, this is going to give us what we expect to see. This, on the other hand, is going to give us something we don't expect to see. But it's just, again, a case of, we're using the same operator to mean two different things, and the language sometimes has to make a best guess. So it's not always a great thing that languages nowadays don't often require us to specify a data type-- if we were able to specify a data type here, we would be able to disambiguate this. But here with JavaScript, it thinks it's being very helpful for us by not specifying a type. And it's going to make our best guess as to what we want to do, but sometimes it guesses wrong. But it gives us ways to work around it if it does indeed guess wrong.
