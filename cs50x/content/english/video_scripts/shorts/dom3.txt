Now, you may have seen that some of those terms, some of those property names and some of those method names are really, really long. It would be a lot to type out to do that. And so it's actually quite common when you are working on a project that has a lot of document object manipulation to use a JavaScript library called jQuery.

jQuery is quite popular. It's probably the most popular JavaScript library currently in use. It's been around for about 10 years now. It's an open source library. And it does a lot of things. But one of the things it does particularly well is simplify what's called client-side scripting, or where you are writing some code to change things on your computer to affect the look and feel of a site. Document object manipulation is one of those things it does really well. And it also does AJAX queries, which we'll talk about in another video on AJAX, quite well also. So for example, the raw JavaScript version of this, what we're doing here in this raw JavaScript is changing one section of the page. I'm finding the element of my page whose ID is colorDiv. So I'm starting from the top of the document. It's going to look through the entire document object, all of those nested nodes below it, to find a section of the page called colorDiv. And I'm going to go there and set that node's style property's backgroundColor property to green.

So basically, all that's happening here is I'm changing the background color of one section of my page to green. That is a lot to type to do that in pure JavaScript. In jQuery, the trade-off is you get a shorter-- you have to type less stuff. You have a shorter line of code. But it's going to look a little bit more weird. So this would do exactly the same thing using jQuery syntax. The dollar sign is a shorthand way of saying jQuery. And it's going to be looking for a section of my page called colorDiv. That's the jQuery syntax for it. And I'm going to change that node's CSS background color to green. Again, it's a little bit strange. But it is a shorter way to do the same thing. So you will often see this as opposed to the longer JavaScript version when you're seeing some client-side scripting.
