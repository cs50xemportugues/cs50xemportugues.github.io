Scratch
-------

*   We can write programs with the building blocks we just discovered:
    *   functions
    *   conditions
    *   Boolean expressions
    *   loops
*   We’ll use a graphical programming language called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), where we’ll drag and drop blocks that contain instructions.
*   Later in our course, we’ll move onto textual programming languages like C, and Python, and JavaScript. All of these languages, including Scratch, has more powerful features like:
    *   variables
        *   the ability to store values and change them
    *   threads
        *   the ability for our program to do multiple things at once
    *   events
        *   the ability to respond to changes in our program or inputs
    *   …
*   The programming environment for Scratch looks like this:  
    ![screenshot of scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/scratch.png)
    *   On the left, we have puzzle pieces that represent functions or variables, or other concepts, that we can drag and drop into our instruction area in the center.
    *   On the right, we have a stage that will be shown by our program to a human, where we can add or change backgrounds, characters (called sprites in Scratch), and more.
*   We can drag a few blocks to make Scratch say “hello, world”:  
    ![screenshot of hello, world](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/hello_world.png)
    *   The “when green flag clicked” block is the start of our program, and below it we’ve snapped in a “say” block and typed in “hello, world”.
*   We can also drag in the “ask and wait” block, with a question like “What’s your name?”, and combine it with a “say” block for the answer:  
    ![screenshot of question and answer](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/answer.png)
*   But we didn’t wait after we said “Hello” with the first block, so we can use the “say () for () seconds” block:  
    ![screenshot of blocks with say for 2 seconds](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/wait.png)
*   We can use the “join” block to combine two phrases so Scratch can say “hello, David”:  
    ![screenshot of join](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/join.png)
    *   Notice that we can nest instructions and variables.
*   In fact, the “say” block itself is like an algorithm, where we provided an input of “hello, world” and it produced the output of Scratch (the cat) “saying” that phrase:  
    ![say as algorithm with "hello, world" as input and cat as output](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/say_algorithm.png)
*   The “ask” block, too, takes in an input (the question we want to ask), and produces the output of the “answer” block:  
    ![ask as algorithm with "What's your name?" as input and answer block as output](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/ask_algorithm.png)
*   We can then use the “answer” block along with our own text, “hello, “, as two inputs to the join algorithm …  
    ![join as algorithm with "hello, " and "answer" as input and "hello, David!" as output](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/join_algorithm.png)
*   … which we pass as input again to the “say” block:  
    ![say as algorithm with "hello, David!" as input and cat as output](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/say_again.png)
*   We can try to make Scratch (the name of the cat) say meow:  
    ![blocks labeled "forever" with "play sound Meow until done" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/forever_meow.png)
    *   But when we click the green flag, we hear the meow sound over and over immediately. Our first bug, or mistake! We can add a block to wait, so the meows sound more normal.  
        ![blocks labeled "forever" with "play sound Meow until done" and "wait 1 seconds" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/forever_meow_wait.png)
*   We can have Scratch point towards the mouse and move towards it:  
    ![blocks labeled "forever" with "point towards mouse-pointer" and "move 10 steps" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/point_towards.png)
*   We’ll look at a sheep that can count:  
    ![blocks labeled "set counter to 1" and "forever" with "say counter for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds", and "change counter by 1" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/count.png)
    *   Here, `counter` is a variable, the value of which we can set, use, and change.
*   We can also have Scratch meow if we touch it with the mouse pointer:  
    ![blocks labeled "forever" with "if touching mouse-pointer? then" and "play sound Meow until done" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/pet0.png)
