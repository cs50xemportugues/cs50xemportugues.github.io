## Expanding Your Imagination

- We showed you in this lecture a number of Scratch programs to stoke your imagination.
- _Oscartime_ is one of David’s own Scratch programs – though the music may haunt him because of the number of hours he listened to it while creating this program. Take a few moments to play through the game yourself.
- Building Oscartime ourselves, we first add the lamp post.

- Then, write code as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        switch costume to (oscar1 v)
        forever
        if <touching (mouse-pointer v)?> then
        switch costume to (oscar2 v)
        else
        switch costume to (oscar1 v)

  Notice that moving your mouse over Oscar changes his costume. You can learn more by [exploring these code blocks](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/565100517).

- Then, modify your code as follow to create a falling piece of trash:

        when green flag clicked
        go to x: (pick random (-240) to (240)) y: (180)
        forever
        if <(distance to (floor v)) > (0)> then
        change y by (-3)

  Notice that the trash’s position on the y-axis always begins at 180. The x position is randomized. While the trash is above the floor, it goes down 3 pixels at a time. You can learn more by [exploring these code blocks](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/565117390).

- Next, modify your code as follows to allow for the possibility of dragging trash.

        when green flag clicked
        forever
        if <<mouse down?> and <touching (mouse-pointer v) ?>> then
        go to (mouse-pointer v)

- Next, we can implement the scoring variables as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        forever
        if <touching (Oscar v) ?> then
        change (score) by (1)
        go to x: (pick random (-240) to (240)) y: (180)
