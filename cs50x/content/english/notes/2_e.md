Command-Line Arguments
----------------------

*   `Command-line arguments` are those arguments that are passed to your program at the command line. For example, all those statements you typed after `clang` are considered command line arguments. You can use these arguments in your own programs!
*   In your terminal window, type `code greet.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this says `hello` to the user.
    
*   Still, would it not be nice to be able to take arguments before the program even runs? Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(int argc, string argv[])
        {
            if (argc == 2)
            {
                printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
            }
            else
            {
                printf("hello, world\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that this program knows both `argc`, the number of command line arguments, and `argv` which is an array of the characters passed as arguments at the command line.
    
*   Therefore, using the syntax of this program, executing `./greet David` would result in the program saying `hello, David`.
