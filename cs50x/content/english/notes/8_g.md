*   It turns out that we can move all our style code into a special file called a _CSS_ file. We can create a file called `style.css` and paste our classes there:
    
        .centered
        {
            text-align: center;
        }
        
        .large
        {
            font-size: large;
        }
        
        .medium
        {
            font-size: medium;
        }
        
        .small
        {
            font-size: small;
        }
        
    
    Notice that this is verbatim what appeared in our HTML file.
    
*   We then can tell the browser where to locate the CSS for this HTML file:
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        
        <!-- Demonstrates external stylesheets -->
        
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
                <title>css</title>
            </head>
            <body class="centered">
                <header class="large">
                    John Harvard
                </header>
                <main class="medium">
                    Welcome to my home page!
                </main>
                <footer class="small">
                    Copyright &#169; John Harvard
                </footer>
            </body>
        </html>
        
    
    Notice that `style.css` is linked to this HTML file as a stylesheet, telling the browser where to locate the styles we created.
    

Frameworks
----------

*   Similar to third-party libraries we can leverage in Python, there are third-party libraries called _frameworks_ that we can utilize with our HTML files.
*   _Bootstrap_ is one of these frameworks that we can use to beautify our HTML and easily perfect design elements such that our pages are more readable.
*   Bootstrap can be utilized by adding the following `link` tag in the `head` of your html file:
    
        <head>
            <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-Zenh87qX5JnK2Jl0vWa8Ck2rdkQ2Bzep5IDxbcnCeuOxjzrPF/et3URy9Bv1WTRi" crossorigin="anonymous">
            <title>favorites</title>
        </head>
        
    
*   You can learn more about this in the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/).
