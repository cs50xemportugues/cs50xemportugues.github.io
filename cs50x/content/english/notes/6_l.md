CSV
---

*   You can also utilize Python to engage with CSV files. Consider the following program called `phonebook.py`:
    
        # Saves names and numbers to a CSV file
        
        import csv
        
        # Get name and number
        name = input("Name: ")
        number = input("Number: ")
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
        
            # Print to file
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow([name, number])
        
    
    Notice that utilizing the `with` block of code, with the `writer` and its work happening below it indented, prevents us from needing to `close` our file once finished.
    
*   Commonly, CSV files have columns that carry specific names. A `DictWriter` can used to create the CSV file and assign specific names to each column. Consider the following modification to our code:
    
        # Saves names and numbers to a CSV file using a DictWriter
        
        import csv
        
        # Get name and number
        name = input("Name: ")
        number = input("Number: ")
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
        
            # Print to file
            writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "number"])
            writer.writerow({"name": name, "number": number})
        
    
    Notice the `name` and `number` columns are defined in the penultimate row of code, and values are added in the final line.
    
*   You can learn more about the CSV files in Python in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
    

Speech
------

*   Using a third-party library, Python can do text-to-speech.
    
        # Says hello to someone
        
        import pyttsx3
        
        engine = pyttsx3.init()
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        engine.say(f"hello, {name}")
        engine.runAndWait()
        
    
*   Further, you can run the following code:
    
        # Says "This was CS50"
        
        import pyttsx3
        
        engine = pyttsx3.init()
        engine.say("This was CS50")
        engine.runAndWait()
        
    

Summing Up
----------

In this lesson, you learned how the building blocks of programming from prior lessons can be implemented within Python. Further, you learned about how Python allowed for more simplified code. Also, you learned how to utilize various Python libraries. In the end, you learned that your skills as a programmer are not limited to a single programming language. Already, you are seeing how you are discovering a new way of learning through this course that could serve you in any programming language – and, perhaps, in nearly any avenue of learning! Specifically, we discussed…

*   Python
*   Variables
*   Conditionals
*   Loops
*   Types
*   Libraries
*   Dictionaries
*   Command-line arguments
*   Regular expressions
