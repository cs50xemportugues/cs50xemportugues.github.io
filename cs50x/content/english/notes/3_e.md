Recursion
---------

*   Recall that in week 0, we had pseudocode for finding a name in a phone book, where we had lines telling us to “go back” and repeat some steps:
    
        1  Pick up phone book
        2  Open to middle of phone book
        3  Look at page
        4  If Smith is on page
        5      Call Mike
        6  Else if Smith is earlier in book
        7      Open to middle of left half of book
        8      **Go back to line 3**
        9  Else if Smith is later in book
        10     Open to middle of right half of book
        11     **Go back to line 3**
        12 Else
        13     Quit
        
    
*   We could instead just repeat our entire algorithm on the half of the book we have left:
    
        1  Pick up phone book
        2  Open to middle of phone book
        3  Look at page
        4  If Smith is on page
        5      Call Mike
        6  Else if Smith is earlier in book
        7      **Search left half of book**
        8
        9  Else if Smith is later in book
        10     **Search right half of book**
        11
        12 Else
        13     Quit
        
    
    *   This seems like a cyclical process that will never end, but we’re actually dividing the problem in half each time, and stopping once there’s no more book left.
*   **Recursion** occurs when a function or algorithm refers to itself, as in the new pseudocode above.
*   In week 1, too, we implemented a “pyramid” of blocks in the following shape:
    
        #
        ##
        ###
        ####
        
    
    *   And we might have had iterative code like this:
        
            #include <cs50.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            
            void draw(int h);
            
            int main(void)
            {
                // Get height of pyramid
                int height = get_int("Height: ");
            
                // Draw pyramid
                draw(height);
            }
            
            void draw(int h)
            {
                // Draw pyramid of height h
                for (int i = 1; i <= h; i++)
                {
                    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
                    {
                        printf("#");
                    }
                    printf("\n");
                }
            }
            
        
        *   Here, we use `for` loops to print each block in each row.
*   But notice that a pyramid of height 4 is actually a pyramid of height 3, with an extra row of 4 blocks added on. And a pyramid of height 3 is a pyramid of height 2, with an extra row of 3 blocks. A pyramid of height 2 is a pyramid of height 1, with an extra row of 2 blocks. And finally, a pyramid of height 1 is just a pyramid of height 0, or nothing, with another row of a single block added on.
*   With this idea in mind, we can write:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        void draw(int h);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get height of pyramid
            int height = get_int("Height: ");
        
            // Draw pyramid
            draw(height);
        }
        
        void draw(int h)
        {
            // If nothing to draw
            if (h == 0)
            {
                return;
            }
        
            // Draw pyramid of height h - 1
            draw(h - 1);
        
            // Draw one more row of width h
            for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)
            {
                printf("#");
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Now, our `draw` function first calls itself **recursively**, drawing a pyramid of height `h - 1`. But even before that, we need to stop if `h` is 0, since there won’t be anything left to drawn.
    *   After, we draw the next row, or a row of width `h`.
