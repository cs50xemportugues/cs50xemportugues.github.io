## Abstraction

- Along with pseudocoding, _abstraction_ is an essential skill and concept within computer programming.
- Abstraction is the act of simplifying a problem into smaller and smaller problems.
- For example, if you were hosting a huge dinner for your friends, the _problem_ of having to cook the entire meal could be quite overwhelming! However, if you break down the task of cooking the meal into smaller and smaller tasks (or problems), the big task of creating this delicious meal might feel less challenging.
- In programming, and even within Scratch, we can see abstraction in action. In your programming area, program as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        play sound (Meow v) until done
        wait (1) seconds
        play sound (Meow v) until done
        wait (1) seconds
        play sound (Meow v) until done

  Notice that you are doing the same thing over and over again. Indeed, if you see yourself repeatedly coding the same statements, it’s likely the case that you could program more artfully – abstracting away this repetitive code.

- You can modify your code as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        repeat (3)
        play sound (Meow v) until done
        wait (1) seconds

  Notice that the loop does exactly as the previous program did. However, the problem is simplified by abstracting away the repetition to a block that _repeats_ the code for us.

- We can even advance this further by using the `define` block, where you can create your own block (your own function)! Write code as follows:

  ![scratch define](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Scratch6.png "scratch define") Notice that we are defining our own block called `meow`. The function plays the sound `meow`, then waits one second. Below that, you can see that when the green flag is clicked, our meow function is repeated three times.

- We can even provide a way by which the function can take an input `n` and repeat a number of times:

        define meow
        play sound (Meow v) until done
        wait (1) seconds

        when green flag clicked
        repeat (3)
        meow

  Notice how `n` is taken from “meow n times.” `n` is passed to the meow function through the `define` block.

- The cat, by the way, we can call a `sprite` – a general term used in game programming for an object or character on the screen with which the player will interact.

## If

- _conditionals_ are an essential building block of programming, where the program looks to see if a specific condition has been met. If a condition is met, the program does something.
- To illustrate a conditional, write code as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        forever
        if <touching (mouse-pointer v)?> then
        play sound (Meow v) until done

  Notice that the `forever` block is utilized such that the `if` block is triggered over and over again, such that it can check continuously if the cat is touching the mouse pointer.

- We can modify our program as follows to integrate video sensing:

        when video motion > (50)
        play sound (Meow v) until done

- Remember, programming is often a process of trial and error. If you get frustrated, take time to talk yourself through the problem at hand. What is the specific problem that you are working on right now? What is working? What is not working?
