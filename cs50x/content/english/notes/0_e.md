Pseudocode
----------

*   We can write _pseudocode_, an informal syntax that is just a more specific version of English (or other human language) that represents our algorithm:
    ```
    1  Pick up phone book
    2  Open to middle of phone book
    3  Look at page
    4  If Smith is on page
    5      Call Mike
    6  Else if Smith is earlier in book
    7      Open to middle of left half of book
    8      Go back to line 3
    9  Else if Smith is later in book
    10     Open to middle of right half of book
    11     Go back to line 3
    12 Else
    13     Quit
    ```

*   Some of these lines start with verbs, or actions. We’ll start calling these _functions_:
    <pre>
    1  <b>Pick up</b> phone book
    2  <b>Open to</b> middle of phone book
    3  <b>Look at</b> page
    4  If Smith is on page  
    5      <b>Call</b> Mike
    6  Else if Smith is earlier in book
    7      <b>Open to</b> middle of left half of book
    8      Go back to line 3
    9  Else if Smith is later in book
    10     <b>Open to</b> middle of right half of book
    11     Go back to line 3
    12 Else
    13     <b>Quit</b>
    </pre>
  
*   We also have branches that lead to different paths, like forks in the road, which we’ll call _conditions_:
    <pre>
    1  Pick up phone book
    2  Open to middle of phone book
    3  Look at page
    4  <b>If</b> Smith is on page
    5      Call Mike
    6  <b>Else if</b> Smith is earlier in book
    7      Open to middle of left half of book
    8      Go back to line 3
    9  <b>Else if</b> Smith is later in book
    10     Open to middle of right half of book
    11     Go back to line 3
    12 <b>Else</b>
    13     Quit
    </pre>

*   And the questions that decide where we go are called _Boolean expressions_, which eventually result to a value of true or false:
    <pre>
    1  Pick up phone book
    2  Open to middle of phone book
    3  Look at page
    4  If <b>Smith is on page</b>
    5      Call Mike
    6  Else if <b>Smith is earlier in book</b>
    7      Open to middle of left half of book
    8      Go back to line 3
    9  Else if <b>Smith is later in book</b>
    10     Open to middle of right half of book
    11     Go back to line 3
    12 Else
    13     Quit
    </pre>

*   Finally, we have words that lead to cycles, where we can repeat parts of our program, called _loops_:
    <pre>
    1  Pick up phone book
    2  Open to middle of phone book
    3  Look at page
    4  If Smith is on page
    5      Call Mike
    6  Else if Smith is earlier in book
    7      Open to middle of left half of book
    8      <b>Go back to line 3</b>
    9  Else if Smith is later in book
    10     Open to middle of right half of book
    11     <b>Go back to line 3</b>
    12 Else
    13     Quit
    </pre>
