## Sprite Movement

- Moving away from Oscartime to Ivy’s Hardest Game, we can now imagine how to implement movement within our program.
- Our program has three main components.
- First, write code as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        go to x: (0) y: (0)
        forever
        listen for keyboard
        feel for walls

  Notice that when the green flag is clicked, our sprite moves to the center of the stage at coordinates (0,0) and then listens for the keyboard and checks for walls forever.

- Second, add this second group of code blocks:

        define listen for keyboard
        if <key (up arrow v) pressed?> then
        change y by (1)
        end
        if <key (down arrow v) pressed?> then
        change y by (-1)
        end
        if <key (right arrow v) pressed?> then
        change x by (1)
        end
        if <key (left arrow v) pressed?> then
        change x by (-1)
        end

  Notice how we have created a custom `listen for keyboard` script. For each of our arrow keys on the keyboard, it will move the sprite around the screen.

- Finally, add this group of code blocks:

        define feel for walls
        if <touching (left wall v) ?> then
        change x by (1)
        end
        if <touching (right wall v) ?> then
        change x by (-1)
        end

  Notice how we also have a custom `feel for walls` script. When a sprite touches a wall, it moves it back to a safe position – preventing it from walking off the screen.
