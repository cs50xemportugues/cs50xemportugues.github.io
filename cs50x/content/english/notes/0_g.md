*   Alternatively, we can have Scratch roar if we do:  
    ![blocks labeled "forever" with "if touching mouse-pointer? then" and "play sound roar until done" nested inside, and "else", "play sound Meow until done", "wait 1 seconds"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/pet1.png)
    *   Here, we have two different branches, or conditions, that will repeat forever. If the mouse is touching it, Scratch will “roar”, otherwise it will just meow.
*   We can make Scratch move back and forth on the screen with a few more blocks we can discover by looking around:  
    ![blocks labeled "set rotation style left-right" and "forever" with "move 10 steps", "if touching edge? then" and "play sound ouch until done", "turn 180 degrees"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/ouch.png)
    *   We can even record our own sound to play.
*   With two different “costumes,” or images of Scratch with its legs in different positions, we can even simulate an animated walking motion:  
    ![blocks labeled "set rotation style left-right" and "forever" with "move 10 steps", "if touching edge? then" with "play sound ouch until done", "turn 180 degrees" nested inside, and "next costume"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/bounce.png)
*   We look at another program, bark, where we can use the space bar to mute a sea lion:  
    ![blocks labeled "set muted to false" and "forever" with if key space pressed? then" with "if muted = true then" and "set muted to false" and "else" and "set muted to true" nested inside, and "wait 1 seconds"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/bark.png)
    *   We have a variable, `muted`, that’s `false` by default. And our program will constantly check if the space bar is pressed, and set muted to `false` if it’s `true`, or `true` if not. This way, we can toggle whether the sound plays or not, since our other set of blocks for the sea lion check the `muted` variable:  
        ![blocks labeled "forever" with if muted = false then" with "start sound SeaLion" and "think hi hi hi for 2 seconds" nested inside, and "wait 1 seconds"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/bark1.png)
*   With multiple sprites, or characters, we can have different sets of blocks for each of them:  
    ![blocks labeled "forever" with if key space pressed? then" with "say Marco! for 2 seconds" and "broadcast event" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/marco.png)
    *   For one puppet, we have these blocks that say “Marco!”, and then a “broadcast event” block. This “event” is used for our two sprites to communicate with each other, like sending a secret message. So our other puppet can just wait for this event to say “Polo!”:  
        ![blocks labeled "when I receive event", "say Polo! for 2 seconds"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/polo.png)
*   Now that we know some basics, we can think about the design, or quality of our programs. For example, we might want to have Scratch cough three times by repeating some blocks:  
    ![blocks labeled "say cough for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds", "say cough for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds", "say cough for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/cough0.png)
*   While this is correct, we can avoid repeating blocks with a loop:  
    ![blocks labeled "repeat 3" with "say cough for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds" nested inside](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/cough1.png)
*   The next step is abstracting away some of our code into a function, or making it reusable in different ways. We can make a block called “cough” and put some blocks inside it:  
    ![two sets of blocks. the first set of blocks is: "define cough", "say cough for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds". the second set is: "when green flag clicked", "repeat 3", "cough"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/cough_function.png)
    *   Now, all of our sprites can use the same “cough” block, in as many places as we’d like.
*   We can even put a number of times into our cough function, so we only need a single block to cough any number of times:  
    ![two sets of blocks. the first set of blocks is: "define cough n times", "repeat n", say cough for 1 seconds", "wait 1 seconds". the second set is: "when green flag clicked", "cough 3 times"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/cough_function_2.png)
*   We look at some examples and discuss how we might implement components of them with different sprites that follow the mouse cursor, or cause something else to happen on the stage.
*   Welcome aboard!
