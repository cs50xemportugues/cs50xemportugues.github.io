*   Modify your code as follows:
    
        # Searches database popularity of a problem
        
        import csv
        
        from cs50 import SQL
        
        # Open database
        db = SQL("sqlite:///favorites.db")
        
        # Prompt user for favorite
        favorite = input("Favorite: ")
        
        # Search for title
        rows = db.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites WHERE problem LIKE ?", "%" + favorite + "%")
        
        # Get first (and only) row
        row = rows[0]
        
        # Print popularity
        print(row["COUNT(*)"])
        
    
    Notice that `db = SQL("sqlite:///favorites.db")` provide Python the location of the database file. Then, the line that begins with `rows` executes SQL commands utilizing `db.execute`. Indeed, this command passes the syntax within the quotation marks to the `db.execute` function. We can issue any SQL command using this syntax. Further, notice that `rows` is returned as a list of dictionaries. In this case, there is only one result, one row, returned to the rows list as a dictionary.
    

Race Conditions
---------------

*   Utilization of SQL can sometimes result in some problems.
*   You can imagine a case where multiple users could be accessing the same database and executing commands at the same time.
*   This could result in glitches where code is interrupted by other people’s actions. This could result in a loss of data.
*   Built-in SQL features such as `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` help avoid some of these race condition problems.

SQL Injection Attacks
---------------------

*   Now, still considering the code above, you might be wondering what the `?` question marks do above. One of the problems that can arise in real-world applications of SQL is what is called an _injection attack_. An injection attack is where a malicious actor could input malicious SQL code.
*   For example, consider a login screen as follows:
    
    ![harvard key login screen with username and password fields](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/7/cs50Week7Slide051.png "harvard key login screen")
    
*   Without the proper protections in our own code, a bad actor could run malicious code. Consider the following:
    
        rows = db.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites WHERE problem LIKE ?", "%" + favorite + "%")
        
    
    Notice that because the `?` is in place, validation can be run on `favorite` before it is blindly accepted by the query.
    
*   You never want to utilize formatted strings in queries as above or blindly trust the user’s input.
*   Utilizing the CS50 Library, the library will _sanitize_ and remove any potentially malicious characters.

Summing Up
----------

In this lesson, you learned more syntax related to Python. Further, you learned how to integrate this knowledge with data in the form of flat-file and relational databases. Finally, you learned about _SQL_. Specifically, we discussed…

*   SQL
*   `JOIN`s
*   Indexes
*   Using SQL in Python
*   Race conditions
*   SQL injection attacks
