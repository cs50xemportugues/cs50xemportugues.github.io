Overflow
--------

*   A _heap overflow_ is when you overflow the heap, touching areas of memory you are not supposed to.
*   A _stack overflow_ is when too many functions are called, overflowing the amount of memory available.
*   Both of these are considered _buffer overflows_.

`scanf`
-------

*   In CS50, we have created functions like `get_int` to simplify the act of getting input from the user.
*   `scanf` is a built-in function that can get user input.
*   We can reimplement `get_int` rather easily using `scanf` as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int x;
            printf("x: ");
            scanf("%i", &x);
            printf("x: %i\n", x);
        }
        
    
    Notice that the value of `x` is stored at the location of `x` in the line `scanf("%i", &x)`.
    
*   However, attempting to reimplement `get_string` is not easy. Consider the following:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s;
            printf("s: ");
            scanf("%s", s);
            printf("s: %s\n", s);
        }
        
    
    Notice that no `&` is required because strings are special. Still, this program will not function. Nowhere in this program do we allocate the amount of memory required for our string.
    
*   We can modify our code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char s[4];
            printf("s: ");
            scanf("%s", s);
            printf("s: %s\n", s);
        }
        
    
    Notice that if we pre-allocate an array of size `4`, we can type `cat` and the program functions. However, a string larger than this would create an error.
