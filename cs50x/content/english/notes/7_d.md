Multiple tables
---------------

*   But each of the rows will only have one column for genres, and the values are multiple genres put together. So we can go back to our import program, and add another table:
    
        import cs50
        import csv
        
        # Create database
        open(f"shows4.db", "w").close()
        db = cs50.SQL("sqlite:///shows4.db")
        
        # Create tables
        db.execute("CREATE TABLE shows (id INT, title TEXT, year NUMERIC, PRIMARY KEY(id))")
        
        # The `genres` table will have a column called `show_id` that references
        # the `shows` table above
        db.execute("CREATE TABLE genres (show_id INT, genre TEXT, FOREIGN KEY(show_id) REFERENCES shows(id))")
        
        # Open TSV file
        # https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz
        with open("title.basics.tsv", "r") as titles:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(titles, delimiter="\t")
        
            # Iterate over TSV file
            for row in reader:
        
                # If non-adult TV show
                if row["titleType"] == "tvSeries" and row["isAdult"] == "0":
        
                    # If year not missing
                    if row["startYear"] != "\\N":
        
                        # If since 1970
                        startYear = int(row["startYear"])
                        if startYear >= 1970:
        
                            # Trim prefix from tconst
                            id = int(row["tconst"][2:])
        
                            # Insert show
                            db.execute("INSERT INTO shows (id, title, year) VALUES(?, ?, ?)", id, row["primaryTitle"], startYear)
        
                            # Insert genres
                            if row["genres"] != "\\N":
                                for genre in row["genres"].split(","):
                                    db.execute("INSERT INTO genres (show_id, genre) VALUES(?, ?)", id, genre)
        
    
    *   So now our `shows` table no longer has a `genres` column, but instead we have a `genres` table with each row representing a show and an associated genre. Now, a particular show can have multiple genres we can search for, and we can get other data about the show from the `shows` table given its ID.
