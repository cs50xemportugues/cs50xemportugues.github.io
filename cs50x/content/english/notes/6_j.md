Exit Status
-----------

*   The `sys` library also has built-in methods. We can use `sys.exit(i)` to exit the program with a specific exit code:
    
        # Exits with explicit value, importing sys
        
        import sys
        
        if len(sys.argv) != 2:
            print("Missing command-line argument")
            sys.exit(1)
        
        print(f"hello, {sys.argv[1]}")
        sys.exit(0)
        
    
    Notice that dot-notation is used to utilize the built-in functions of `sys`.
    

Search
------

*   Python can also be utilized to search. In your terminal window, type `code names.py` and write code as follows:
    
        # Implements linear search for names
        
        import sys
        
        # A list of names
        names = ["Bill", "Charlie", "Fred", "George", "Ginny", "Percy", "Ron"]
        
        # Ask for name
        name = input("Name: ")
        
        # Search for name
        if name in names:
            print("Found")
            sys.exit(0)
        
        print("Not found")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    
    Notice that this code functions. Indeed, it implements a linear search.
    
*   You can utilize the built-in abilities of Python as follows:
    
        # Implements linear search for names using `in`
        
        import sys
        
        # A list of names
        names = ["Bill", "Charlie", "Fred", "George", "Ginny", "Percy", "Ron"]
        
        # Ask for name
        name = input("Name: ")
        
        # Search for name
        if name in names:
            print("Found")
            sys.exit(0)
        
        print("Not found")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    
    Notice that the `in` preposition is utilized. Python understands how to implement the lower-level code to do a linear search.
