*   Next, create a file in the `templates` folder called `index.html` by typing `code templates/index.html` and write code as follows:
    
        {% extends "layout.html" %}
        
        {% block body %}
            <h1>Register</h1>
            <form action="/register" method="post">
                <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text">
                <select name="sport">
                    <option disabled selected>Sport</option>
                    {% for sport in sports %}
                        <option value="{{ sport }}">{{ sport }}</option>
                    {% endfor %}
                </select>
                <button type="submit">Register</button>
            </form>
        {% endblock %}
        
    
*   Next, create a file called `layout.html` by typing `code templates/layout.html` and write code as follows:
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
                <title>froshims</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                {% block body %}{% endblock %}
            </body>
        </html>
        
    
*   Fourth, create a file in templates called `success.html` as follows:
    
        {% extends "layout.html" %}
        
        {% block body %}
            You are registered!
        {% endblock %}
        
    
*   Finally, create a file in templates called `failure.html` as follows:
    
        {% extends "layout.html" %}
        
        {% block body %}
            You are not registered!
        {% endblock %}
        
    
*   You can imagine how we might want to accept the registration of many different registrants. We can improve `app.py` as follows:
    
        # Implements a registration form, storing registrants in a dictionary, with error messages
        
        from flask import Flask, redirect, render_template, request
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        REGISTRANTS = {}
        
        SPORTS = [
            "Basketball",
            "Soccer",
            "Ultimate Frisbee"
        ]
        
        
        @app.route("/")
        def index():
            return render_template("index.html", sports=SPORTS)
        
        
        @app.route("/register", methods=["POST"])
        def register():
        
            # Validate name
            name = request.form.get("name")
            if not name:
                return render_template("error.html", message="Missing name")
        
            # Validate sport
            sport = request.form.get("sport")
            if not sport:
                return render_template("error.html", message="Missing sport")
            if sport not in SPORTS:
                return render_template("error.html", message="Invalid sport")
        
            # Remember registrant
            REGISTRANTS[name] = sport
        
            # Confirm registration
            return redirect("/registrants")
        
        
        @app.route("/registrants")
        def registrants():
            return render_template("registrants.html", registrants=REGISTRANTS)
        
    
    Notice that a dictionary called `REGISTRANTS` is used to log the `sport` selected by `REGISTRANTS[name]`. Also, notice that `registrants=REGISTRANTS` passes the dictionary on to this template.
    
*   Further, create a new template called `registrants.html` as follows:
    
        {% extends "layout.html" %}
        
        {% block body %}
            <h1>Registrants</h1>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Sport</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    {% for name in registrants %}
                        <tr>
                            <td>{{ name }}</td>
                            <td>{{ registrants[name] }}</td>
                        </tr>
                    {% endfor %}
                </tbody>
            </table>
        {% endblock %}
        
    
    Notice that `{% for name in registrants %}...{% endfor %}` will iterate through each of the registrants. Very powerful to be able to iterate on a dynamic web page!
    
*   Executing `flask run` and entering numerous names and sports, you can browse to `/registrants` to view what data has been logged.
*   You now have a web application! However, there are some security flaws! Because everything is client-side, an adversary could change the HTML and _hack_ a website. Further, this data will not persist if the server is shut down. Could there be some way we could have our data persist even when the server restarts?
