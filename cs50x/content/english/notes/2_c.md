Arrays
------

*   In Week 0, we talked about _data types_ such as `bool`, `int`, `char`, `string`, etc.
*   Each data type requires a certain amount of system resources:
    *   `bool` 1 byte
    *   `int` 4 bytes
    *   `long` 8 bytes
    *   `float` 4 bytes
    *   `double` 8 bytes
    *   `char` 1 byte
    *   `string` ? bytes
*   Inside of your computer, you have a finite amount of memory available.
    
    ![memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide084.png "memory")
    
*   Physically, on the memory of your computer, you can imagine how specific types of data are stored on your computer. You might imagine that a `char`, which only requires 1 byte of memory, may look as follows:
    
    ![1 byte](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide087.png "1 byte")
    
*   Similarly, an `int`, which requires 4 bytes might look as follows:
    
    ![4 bytes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide088.png "4 bytes")
    
*   We can create a program that explores these concepts. Inside your terminal, type `code scores.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int score1 = 72;
            int score2 = 73;
            int score3 = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3.0);
        }
        
    
    Notice that the number on the right is a floating point value of `3.0`, such that the calculation is rendered as a floating point value in the end.
    
*   Running `make scores`, the program runs.
*   You can imagine how these variables are stored in memory:
    
    ![scores in memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide098.png "scores in memory")
    
*   _Arrays_ are a way of storing data back-to-back in memory such that this data is easily accessible.
*   `int scores[3]` is a way of telling the compiler to provide you three back-to-back places in memory of size `int` to store three `scores`. Considering our program, you can revise your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int scores[3];
            scores[0] = 72;
            scores[1] = 73;
            scores[2] = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / 3.0);
        }
        
    
    Notice that `score[0]` examines the value at this location of memory by `indexing into` the array called `scores` at location `0` to see what value is stored there.
    
*   You can see how while the above code works, there is still an opportunity for improving our code. Revise your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get scores
            int scores[3];
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
            }
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / 3.0);
        }
        
    
    Notice how we index into `scores` by using `scores[i]` where `i` is supplied by the `for` loop.
    
*   We can simplify or _abstract away_ the calculation of the average. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        // Constant
        const int N = 3;
        
        // Prototype
        float average(int length, int array[]);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get scores
            int scores[N];
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            {
                scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
            }
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", average(N, scores));
        }
        
        float average(int length, int array[])
        {
            // Calculate average
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
            {
                sum += array[i];
            }
            return sum / (float) length;
        }
        
    
    Notice that a new function called `average` is declared. Further, notice that a `const` or constant value of `N` is declared. Most importantly, notice how the `average` function takes `int array[]`, which means that the compiler passes an array to this function.
    
*   Not only can arrays be containers: They can be passed between functions.
