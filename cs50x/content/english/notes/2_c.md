check50 and style50
-------------------

*   We can run a command like `check50 cs50/problems/hello`, where `check50` is a program that will follow instructions identified by the argument `cs50/problems/hello` to upload, run, and test our program on CS50’s servers. This will check our program for correctness.
    *   When writing software in the real world, developers will generally write their own tests to ensure their code works as they expect, especially as more features are added to the same code.
*   `style50` is another program that will check our code for aesthetic issues, such as whitespace, such that our code is more readable and maintainable. For example, we might be missing indentation. And the [Style Guide](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/) will include more explanations for what we expect.
*   We can even use rubber duck debugging, a method where we explain what we’re trying to do to a rubber duck, such that we realize what we’re trying to do and what we should fix.
*   We also want to write our code with good design, where we not only solve the problem correctly but well, where we make reasonable choices for how our program runs, and make tradeoffs between time, development cost, and memory.

Data Types
----------

*   In C, we have different types of variables we can use for storing data:
    *   bool 1 byte
    *   char 1 byte
    *   int 4 bytes
    *   float 4 bytes
    *   long 8 bytes
    *   double 8 bytes
    *   string ? bytes
*   Each of these types take up a certain number of bytes per variable we create, and the sizes above are what the sandbox, IDE, and most likely your computer uses for each type in C.

Memory
------

*   Inside our computers, we have chips called RAM, random-access memory, that stores data for short-term use. We might save a program or file to our hard drive (or SSD) for long-term storage, but when we open it, it gets copied to RAM first. Though RAM is much smaller, and temporary (until the power is turned off), it is much faster.
*   We can think of bytes, stored in RAM, as though they were in a grid:  
    ![computer chip with grid overlaid](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/ram.png)
    *   In reality, there are millions or billions of bytes per chip.
*   In C, when we create a variable of type `char`, which will be sized one byte, it will physically be stored in one of those boxes in RAM. An integer, with 4 bytes, will take up four of those boxes.
*   And each of these boxes is labeled with some number, or address, from 0, to 1, to 2, and so on.
