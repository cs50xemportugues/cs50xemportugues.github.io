*   Recall a few weeks ago our challenge of building three blocks on top of one another, like in Mario.

*   In Python, we can implement something akin to this as follows:
    
        # Prints a column of 3 bricks with a loop
        
        for i in range(3):
            print("#")
        
    
*   In C, we had the advantage of a `do-while` loop. However, in Python it is convention to utilize a `while` loop, as Python does not have a `do while` loop. You can write code as follows in a file called `mario.py`:
    
        # Prints a column of bricks, using a helper function to get input
        
        from cs50 import get_int
        
        
        def main():
            height = get_height()
            for i in range(height):
                print("#")
        
        
        def get_height():
            while True:
                n = get_int("Height: ")
                if n > 0:
                    return n
        
        
        main()
        
    
    Notice how the scope of `n` is everywhere in the `get_height` function once it is assigned a value. Further notice that by convention, there are double spaces between functions.
    
*   We can take away the training wheels of the CS50 library as follows:
    
        # Prints a column of bricks, catching exceptions
        
        def main():
            height = get_height()
            for i in range(height):
                print("#")
        
        
        def get_height():
            while True:
                try:
                    n = int(input("Height: "))
                    if n > 0:
                        return n
                except ValueError:
                    print("Not an integer")
        
        
        main()
        
    
    Notice that `try` is utilized to attempt to convert `n` to an integer. If it cannot do so, an error is outputted.
    
*   Consider the following image:
    
    ![four horizontal question blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide075.png "mario blocks")
    
*   In Python, we could implement by modifying your code as follows:
    
        # Prints a row of 4 question marks with a loop
        
        for i in range(4):
            print("?", end="")
        print()
        
    
    Notice that you can override the behavior of the `print` function to stay on the same line as the previous print.
    
*   Similar in spirit to previous iterations, we can further simplify this program:
    
        # Prints a row of 4 question marks without a loop
        
        print("?" * 4)
        
    
    Notice that we can utilize `*` to multiply the print statement to repeat `4` times.
    
*   What about a large block of bricks?
    
    ![three by three block of mario blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide078.png "mario blocks")
    
*   To implement the above, you can modify your code as follows:
    
        # Prints a 3-by-3 grid of bricks with loops
        
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                print("#", end="")
            print()
        
    
    Notice how one `for` loop exists inside another. The `print` statement adds a new line at the end of each row of bricks.
    
*   You can learn more about the `print` function in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)
