*   We can change the column we are examining, focusing on our favorite problem instead:
    
        # Favorite problem instead of favorite language
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["problem"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        # Print counts
        for favorite in sorted(counts, key=lambda problem: counts[problem], reverse=True):
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
        
    
    Notice that `problem` replaced `language`.
    
*   What if we wanted to allow users to provide input directly in the terminal? We can modify our code, leveraging our previous knowledge about user input:
    
        # Favorite problem instead of favorite language
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["problem"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        # Print count
        favorite = input("Favorite: ")
        if favorite in counts:
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
        
    
    Notice how compact our code is compared to our experience in C.
