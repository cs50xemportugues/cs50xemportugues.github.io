Image Recognition
-----------------

*   Numerous libraries have been written by contributors to Python.
*   You can utilize these libraries in your own code.
*   For example, you could simply import facial recognition utilizing a Python library like `PIL`.
*   David provided a demo of facial recognition utilizing Python and third-party libraries.

CS50 Library
------------

*   As with C, the CS50 library can be utilized within Python.
*   The following functions will be of particular use:
    
          get_float
          get_int
          get_string
        
    
*   You also have the option of importing only specific functions from the CS50 library as follows:
    
        from CS50 import get_float, get_int, get_string
        
    

Conditionals
------------

*   In C, you might remember a program like this:
    
        // Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt user for integers
            int x = get_int("What's x? ");
            int y = get_int("What's y? ");
        
            // Compare integers
            if (x < y)
            {
                printf("x is less than y\n");
            }
            else if (x > y)
            {
                printf("x is greater than y\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("x is equal to y\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   In Python, it would appear as follows:
    
        # Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
        
        from cs50 import get_int
        
        # Prompt user for integers
        x = get_int("What's x? ")
        y = get_int("What's y? ")
        
        # Compare integers
        if x < y:
            print("x is less than y")
        elif x > y:
            print("x is greater than y")
        else:
            print("x is equal to y")
        
    
    Notice that there are no more curly braces. Instead, indentations are utilized. Second, a colon is utilized in the `if` statement. Further, `elif` replaces `else if`. Parentheses are also no longer required in the `if` and `elif` statements.
