*   Further, we can change `app.py` as follows:
    
        # Adds a form, second route
        
        from flask import Flask, render_template, request
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        
        @app.route("/")
        def index():
            return render_template("index.html")
        
        
        @app.route("/greet")
        def greet():
            return render_template("greet.html", name=request.args.get("name", "world"))
        
    
    Notice that the default path will display a form for the user to input their name. The `/greet` route will pass the `name` to that web page.
    
*   To finalize this implementation, you will need another template for `greet.html` as follows:
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
                <title>hello</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                hello, {{ name }}
            </body>
        </html>
        
    
    Notice that this route will now render the greeting to the user, followed by their name.
    

Layout
------

*   Both of our web pages, `index.html` and `greet.html`, have much of the same data. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to allow the body to be unique, but copy the same layout from page to page?
*   First, create a new template called `layout.html` and write code as follows:
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
                <title>hello</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                {% block body %}{% endblock %}
            </body>
        </html>
        
    
    Notice that the `{% block body %}{% endblock %}` allows for the insertion of other code from other HTML files.
    
*   Then, modify your `index.html` as follows:
    
        {% extends "layout.html" %}
        
        {% block body %}
        
            <form action="/greet" method="post">
                <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text">
                <button type="submit">Greet</button>
            </form>
        
        {% endblock %}
        
    
    Notice that the line `{% extends "layout.html" %}` tells the server where to get the layout of this page. Then, the `{% block body %}{% endblock %}` tells what code to be inserted into `layout.html`.
    
*   Finally, change `greet.html` as follows:
    
        {% extends "layout.html" %}
        
        {% block body %}
            hello, {{ name }}
        {% endblock %}
        
    
    Notice how this code is shorter and more compact.
