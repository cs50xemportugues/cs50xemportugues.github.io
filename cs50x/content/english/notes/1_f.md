=============

*   For each of these examples, you can click on the [sandbox links](../../weeks/1/) to run and edit your own copies of them.
*   In `int.c`, we get and print an integer:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int age = get_int("What's your age?\n");
            int days = age * 365;
            printf("You are at least %i days old.\n", days);
        }
        
    
    *   Notice that we use `%i` to print an integer.
    *   We can now run `make int` and run our program with `./int`.
    *   We can combine lines and remove the `days` variable with:
        
            int age = get_int("What's your age?\n");
            printf("You are at least %i days old.\n", age * 365);
            
        
    *   Or even combine everything in one line:
        
            printf("You are at least %i days old.\n", get_int("What's your age?\n") * 365);
            
        
    *   Though, once a line is too long or complicated, it may be better to keep two or even three lines for readability.
*   In `float.c`, we can get decimal numbers (called floating-point values in computers, because the decimal point can “float” between the digits, depending on the number):
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            float price = get_float("What's the price?\n");
            printf("Your total is %f.\n", price * 1.0625);
        }
        
    
    *   Now, if we compile and run our program, we’ll see a price printed out with tax.
    *   We can specify the number of digits printed after the decimal with a placeholder like `%.2f` for two digits after the decimal point.
*   With `parity.c`, we can check if a number is even or odd:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = get_int("n: ");
        
            if (n % 2 == 0)
            {
                printf("even\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("odd\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   With the `%` (modulo) operator, we can get the remainder of `n` after it’s divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, we know that `n` is even. Otherwise, we know n is odd.
    *   And functions like `get_int` from the CS50 library do error-checking, where only inputs from the user that matches the type we want is accepted.
*   In `conditions.c`, we turn the condition snippets from before into a program:
    
        // Conditions and relational operators
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt user for x
            int x = get_int("x: ");
        
            // Prompt user for y
            int y = get_int("y: ");
        
            // Compare x and y
            if (x < y)
            {
                printf("x is less than y\n");
            }
            else if (x > y)
            {
                printf("x is greater than y\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("x is equal to y\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   Lines that start with `//` are comments, or note for humans that the compiler will ignore.
    *   For David to compile and run this program in his sandbox, he first needed to run `cd src1` in the terminal. This changes the directory, or folder, to the one in which he saved all of the lecture’s source files. Then, he could run `make conditions` and `./conditions`. With `pwd`, he can see that he’s in a `src1` folder (inside other folders). And `cd` by itself, with no arguments, will take us back to our default folder in the sandbox.
*   In `agree.c`, we can ask the user to confirm or deny something:
    
        // Logical operators
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt user to agree
            char c = get_char("Do you agree?\n");
        
            // Check whether agreed
            if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')
            {
                printf("Agreed.\n");
            }
            else if (c == 'N' || c == 'n')
            {
                printf("Not agreed.\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   We use two vertical bars, `||`, to indicate a logical “or”, whether either expression can be true for the condition to be followed.
    *   And if none of the expressions are true, nothing will happen since our program doesn’t have a loop.
*   Let’s implement the coughing program from week 0:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("cough\n");
            printf("cough\n");
            printf("cough\n");
        }
        
    
*   We could use a `for` loop:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                printf("cough\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   By convention, programmers tend to start counting at 0, and so `i` will have the values of `0`, `1`, and `2` before stopping, for a total of three iterations. We could also write `for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)` for the same final effect.
*   We can move the `printf` line to its own function:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        void cough(void);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                cough();
            }
        }
        
        void cough(void)
        {
            printf("cough\n");
        }
        
    
    *   We declared a new function with `void cough(void);`, before our `main` function calls it. The C compiler reads our code from top to bottom, so we need to tell it that the `cough` function exists, before we use it. Then, after our `main` function, we can implement the `cough` function. This way, the compiler knows the function exists, and we can keep our `main` function close to the top.
    *   And our `cough` function doesn’t take any inputs, so we have `cough(void)`.
*   We can abstract `cough` further:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        void cough(int n);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            cough(3);
        }
        
        void cough(int n)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                printf("cough\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   Now, when we want to print “cough” any number of times, we can just call the same function. Notice that, with `void cough(int n)`, we indicate that the `cough` function takes as input an `int`, which we refer to as `n`. And inside `cough`, we use `n` in our `for` loop to print “cough” the right number of times.
*   Let’s look at `positive.c`:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int get_positive_int(void);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = get_positive_int();
            printf("%i\n", i);
        }
        
        // Prompt user for positive integer
        int get_positive_int(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("%s", "Positive Integer: ");
            }
            while (n < 1);
            return n;
        }
        
    
    *   The CS50 library doesn’t have a `get_positive_int` function, but we can write one ourselves. Our function `int get_positive_int(void)` will prompt the user for an `int` and return that `int`, which our main function stores as `i`. In `get_positive_int`, we initialize a variable, `int n`, without assigning a value to it yet. Then, we have a new construct, `do ... while`, which does something _first_, then checks a condition, and repeats until the condition is no longer true.
    *   Once the loop ends because we have an `n` that is not `< 1`, we can return it with the `return` keyword. And back in our `main` function, we can set `int i` to that value.
