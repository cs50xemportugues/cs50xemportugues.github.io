Comments
--------

*   Comments are fundamental parts of a computer program, where you leave explanatory remarks to yourself and others that may be collaborating with you regarding your code.
*   All code you create for this course must include robust comments.
*   Typically each comment is a few words or more, providing the reader an opportunity to understand what is happening in a specific block of code. Further, such comments serve as a reminder for you later when you need to revise your code.
*   Comments involve placing `//` into your code, followed by a comment. Modify your code as follows to integrate comments:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get size of grid
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Size: ");
            }
            while (n < 1);
        
            // Print grid of bricks
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                {
                    printf("#");
                }
                printf("\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice how each comment begins with a `//`.
    

Abstraction
-----------

*   _Abstraction_ is the art of simplifying our code such that it deals with smaller and smaller problems.
*   Looking at your code, you can see how two essential problems in our code are _get size of grid_ and _print grid of bricks_.
*   We can abstract away these two problems into separate functions. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int get_size(void);
        void print_grid(int n);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = get_size();
            print_grid(n);
        }
        
        int get_size(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Size: ");
            }
            while (n < 1);
            return n;
        }
        
        void print_grid(int n)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                {
                    printf("#");
                }
                printf("\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that we have three functions now. First, we have the `main` function that calls two other functions called `get_size` and `print_grid`. Second, we have a second function called `get_size` which includes the exact code we had to accomplish this task prior. Third, we have another function called `print_grid` that prints the grid. Because we abstracted away the essential problems within our program, our `main` function is very short.
