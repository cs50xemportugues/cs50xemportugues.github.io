Tries
-----

*   _Tries_ are another form of data structure.
*   _Tries_ are always searchable in constant time.
*   One downside to _Tries_ is that they tend to take up a large amount of memory. Notice that we need \\(26 \\times 5 = 130\\) `node`s just to store _Hagrid_!
*   _Hagrid_ would be stored as follows:
    
    ![hagrid being spelled with one letter at a time where one letter is associated with one list H from one list A from another and so on ](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide207.png "tries")
    
*   _Harry_ would then be stored as follows:
    
    ![hagrid being spelled with one letter at a time where one letter is associated with one list H from one list A from another and so on and harry being spelled similarly where hagrid and harry share a two common letters H and A](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide209.png "tries")
    

Summing Up
----------

In this lesson, you learned about using pointers to build new data structures. Specifically, we delved intoâ€¦

*   Data structures
*   Stacks and queues
*   Resizing arrays
*   Linked lists
*   Dictionaries
*   Tries

See you next time!
