Dictionaries
------------

*   _Dictionaries_ are another data structure.
*   Dictionaries, like actual book-form dictionaries that have a word and a definition, have a _key_ and a _value_.
*   The _holy grail_ of time complexity is \\(O(1)\\) or _constant time_. That is, the ultimate is for access to be instantaneous.

*   Dictionaries can offer this speed of access.

Hashing and Hash Tables
-----------------------

*   _Hashing_ is the idea of taking a value and being able to output a value that becomes a shortcut to it later.
*   For example, hashing _apple_ may hash as a value of `1`, and _berry_ may be hashed as `2`. Therefore, finding _apple_ is as easy as asking the _hash_ algorithm where _apple_ is stored. While not ideal in terms of design, ultimately, putting all _a_’s in one bucket and _b_’s in another, this concept of _bucketizing_ hashed values illustrates how you can use this concept: a hashed value can be used to shortcut finding such a value.
*   A _hash function_ is an algorithm that reduces a larger value to something small and predictable. Generally, this function takes in an item you wish to add to your hash table, and returns an integer representing the array index in which the item should be placed.
*   A _hash table_ is a fantastic combination of both arrays and linked lists. When implemented in code, a hash table is an _array_ of _pointers_ to _node_s.
*   A hash table could be imagined as follows:
    
    ![a verticle column of 26 boxes one for each letter of the alphabet](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide157.png "alphabet")
    
    Notice that this is an array that is assigned each value of the alphabet.
    
*   Then, at each location of the array, a linked list is used to track each value being stored there:
    
    ![a verticle column of 26 boxes one for each letter of the alphabet with various names from the harry potter unverise emergint to the right albus is with a and harry is with h](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide169.png "alphabet")
    
*   _Collisions_ are when you add values to the hash table, and something already exists at the hashed location. In the above, collisions are simply appended to the end of the list.
*   Collisions can be reduced by better programming your hash table and hash algorithm. You can imagine an improvement upon the above as follows:
    
    ![a verticle column of various boxeds arranged by H A G and H A R with hagrid emerging from H A G and harry emerging from H A R](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide184.png "alphabet")
    
*   You, as the programmer, have to make a decision about the advantages of using more memory to have a large hash table and potentially reducing search time or using less memory and potentially increasing search time.
