Linked Lists
------------

*   In recent weeks, you have learned about three useful primitives. A `struct` is a data type that you can define yourself. A `.` in _dot notation_ allows you to access variables inside that structure. The `*` operator is used to declare a pointer or dereference a variable.
*   Today, you are introduced to the `->` operator. It is an arrow. This operator goes to an address and looks inside of a structure.
*   A _Linked list_ is one of the most powerful data structures within C. A linked list allows you to include values that are located at varying areas of memory. Further, they allow you to dynamically grow and shrink the list as you desire.
*   You might imagine three values stored at three different areas of memory as follows:
    
    ![Three boxes with 1 2 3 in separate areas of memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide036.png "three values in memory")
    
*   How could one stitch together these values in a list?
*   We could imagine this data pictured above as follows:
    
    ![Three boxes with 1 2 3 in separate areas of memory with smaller boxes attached](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide037.png "three values in memory")
    
*   We could utilize more memory to keep track of where the next item is.
    
    ![Three boxes with 1 2 3 in separate areas of memory with smaller boxes attached where memory addresses are in those attached boxes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide041.png "three values in memory")
    
    Notice that NULL is utilized to indicate that nothing else is _next_ in the list.
    
*   By convention, we would keep one more element in memory, a pointer, that keeps track of the first item in the list.
    
    ![Three boxes with 1 2 3 in separate areas of memory with smaller boxes attached where memory addresses are in those attached boxes now with a final box with the memory address of the first box](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide042.png "three values in memory with pointer")
    
*   Abstracting away the memory addresses, the list would appear as follows:
    
    ![Three boxes with in separate areas of memory with smaller boxes with a final box where the one box points to another and another until the end of the boxes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide043.png "three values in memory with pointer")
    
*   These boxes are called _nodes_. A _node_ contains both an _item_ and a pointer called _next_. In code, you can imagine a node as follows:
    
        typedef struct node
        {
            int number;
            struct node *next;
        }
        node;
        
    
    Notice that the item contained within this node is an integer called `number`. Second, a pointer to a node called `next` is included, which will point to another node somewhere in memory.
    
*   Linked lists are not stored in a contiguous block of memory. They can grow as large as you wish, provided that enough system resources exist. The downside, however, is that more memory is required to keep track of the list instead of an array. This is because for each element, you must store not just the value of the element, but also a pointer to the next node. Further, linked lists cannot be indexed into like is possible in an array because we need to pass through the first \\(n - 1\\) elements to find the location of the \\(n\\)th element. Because of this, the list pictured above must be linearly searched. Binary search, therefore, is not possible in a list constructed as above.
    
*   Conceptually, we can imagine the process of creating a linked list. First, `node *list` is declared, but it is of a garbage value.
    
    ![One garbage value](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide055.png "linked list")
    
*   Next, a node called `n` is allocated in memory.
    
    ![One garbage value called n with another pointer called list](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide059.png "linked list")
    
*   Next, the `number` of node is assigned the value `1`.
    
    ![n pointing to a node with 1 as the number and garbage value as the next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide064.png "linked list")
    
*   Next, the node’s `next` field is assigned `NULL`.
    
    ![n pointing to a node with 1 as the number and null as the value of next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide066.png "linked list")
    
*   Next, `list` is pointed at the memory location to where `n` points. `n` and `list` now point to the same place.
    
    ![n and list both pointing to a node with 1 as the number and null as the value of next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide068.png "linked list")
    
*   A new node is then created. Both the `number` and `next` field are both filled with garbage values.
    
    ![list pointing to a node with 1 as the number and null as the value of next and n pointing to a new node with garbage values](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide073.png "linked list")
    
*   The `number` value of `n`’s node (the new node) is updated to `2`.
    
    ![list pointing to a node with 1 as the number and null as the value of next and n pointing to a new node with 2 as the number and garbage as the next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide075.png "linked list")
    
*   Also, the `next` field is updated as well.
    
    ![list pointing to a node with 1 as the number and null as the value of next and n pointing to a new node with 2 as the number and null as the next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide077.png "linked list")
    
*   Most important, we do not want to lose our connection to any of these nodes lest they be lost forever. Accordingly, `n`’s `next` field is pointed to the same memory location as `list`.
    
    ![list pointing to a node with 1 as the number and null as the value of next and n pointing to a new node with 2 as the number and null as the next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide084.png "linked list")
    
*   Finally, `list` is updated to point at `n`. We now have a linked list of two items.
    
    ![list pointing to a node with 1 as the number and next pointing to a node with an n pointing the same place the node with one points to a node with 2 as the number and null as the next](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide086.png "linked list")
