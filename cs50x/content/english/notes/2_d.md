Strings
-------

*   A `string` is simply an array of variables of type `char`: an array of characters.
*   Considering the following image, you can see how a string is an array of characters that begins with the first character and ends with a special character called a `NUL character`:
    
    ![hi with terminator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide116.png "hi with terminator")
    
*   Imagining this in decimal, your array would look like the following:
    
    ![hi with decimal](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide117.png "hi with decimal")
    
*   Implementing this in your own code, type `code hi.c` in the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char c1 = 'H';
            char c2 = 'I';
            char c3 = '!';
        
            printf("%i %i %i\n", c1, c2, c3);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this will output the decimal values of each character.
    
*   To further understand how a `string` works, revise your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = "HI!";
            printf("%i %i %i\n", s[0], s[1], s[2]);
        }
        
    
    Notice how the `printf` statement presents three values from our array called `s`.
    
*   Letâ€™s imagine we want to say both `HI!` and `BYE!`. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = "HI!";
            string t = "BYE!";
        
            printf("%s\n", s);
            printf("%s\n", t);
        }
        
    
    Notice that two strings are declared and used in this example.
    
*   You can visualize this as follow:
    
    ![hi and bye](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide126.png "hi and bye")
    
*   We can further improve this code. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string words[2];
        
            words[0] = "HI!";
            words[1] = "BYE!";
        
            printf("%s\n", words[0]);
            printf("%s\n", words[1]);
        }
        
    
    Notice that both strings are stored within a single array of type `string`.
    
*   A common problem within programming, and perhaps C more specifically, is to discover the length of an array. How could we implement this in code? Type `code length.c` in the terminal window and code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt for user's name
            string name = get_string("Name: ");
        
            // Count number of characters up until '\0' (aka NUL)
            int n = 0;
            while (name[n] != '\0')
            {
                n++;
            }
            printf("%i\n", n);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code loops until the `NUL` character is found.
    
*   Since this is such a common problem within programming, other programmers have created code in the `string.h` library to find the length of a string. You can find the length of a string by modifying your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt for user's name
            string name = get_string("Name: ");
            int length = strlen(name);
            printf("%i\n", length);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code uses the `string.h` library, declared at the top of the file. Further, it uses a function from that library called `strlen`, which calculates the length of the string passed to it.
    
*   `ctype.h` is another library that is quite useful. Imagine we wanted to create a program that converted all lowercase characters to uppercase ones. In the terminal window type `code uppercase.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("Before: ");
            printf("After:  ");
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
            {
                if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
                {
                    printf("%c", s[i] - 32);
                }
                else
                {
                    printf("%c", s[i]);
                }
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code _iterates_ through each value in the string. The program looks at each character. If the character is lowercase, it subtracts the value 32 from it to convert it to uppercase.
    
*   Recalling our previous work from last week, you might remember this ASCII values chart:
    
    ![ascii](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide120.png "ascii")
    
*   When a lowercase character has `32` subtracted from it, it results in an uppercase version of that same character.
*   While the program does what we want, there is an easier way using the `ctype.h` library. Modify your program as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <ctype.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("Before: ");
            printf("After:  ");
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
            {
                if (islower(s[i]))
                {
                    printf("%c", toupper(s[i]));
                }
                else
                {
                    printf("%c", s[i]);
                }
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice that the program uses `islower` to detect if each character is uppercase or lowercase. Then, the `toupper` function is passed `s[i]`. Each character (if lowercase) is converted to uppercase.
    
*   Again, while this program does what is desired, there is an opportunity for improvement. As the documentation for `ctype.h` states, `toupper` is smart enough to know that if it is passed what is already an uppercase letter, it will simply ignore it. Therefore, we no longer need our `if` statement. You can simplify this code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <ctype.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("Before: ");
            printf("After:  ");
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
            {
                printf("%c", toupper(s[i]));
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code is quite simplified, removing the unnecessary `if` statement.
    
*   You can read about all the capabilities of the `ctype` library on the [Manual Pages](https://manual.cs50.io/#ctype.h).
