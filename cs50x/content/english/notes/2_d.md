Arrays
------

*   Let’s say we wanted to store three variables:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char c1 = 'H';
            char c2 = 'I';
            char c3 = '!';
            printf("%c %c %c\n", c1, c2, c3);
        }
        
    
    *   Notice that we use single quotes to indicate a literal character, and double quotes for multiple characters together in a string.
    *   We can compile and run this, to see `H I !`.
*   And we know characters are just numbers, so if we change our string formatting to be `printf("%i %i %i\n", c1, c2, c3);`, we can see the numeric values of each char printed: `72 73 33`.
    *   We can explicitly convert, or cast, each character to an int before we use it, with `(int) c1`, but our compiler can implicitly do that for us.
*   And in memory, we might have three boxes, labeled `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` somehow, each of which representing a byte of binary with the values of each variable.
*   Let’s look at `scores0.c`:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int score1 = 72;
            int score2 = 73;
            int score3 = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %i\n", (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3);
        }
        
    
    *   We can print the average of three numbers, but now we need to make one variable for every score we want to include, and we can’t easily use them later.
*   It turns out, in memory, we can store variables one after another, back-to-back. And in C, a list of variables stored, one after another in a contiguous chunk of memory, is called an **array**.
*   For example, we can use `int scores[3];` to declare an array of 3 integers.
*   And we can assign and use variables in an array with:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int scores[3];
            scores[0] = 72;
            scores[1] = 73;
            scores[2] = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %i\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / 3);
        }
        
    
    *   Notice that arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element, or value, has index 0.
*   And we repeated the value 3, representing the length of our array, in two different places. So we can use a constant, or fixed value, to indicate it should always be the same in both places:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        const int N = 3;
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int scores[N];
            scores[0] = 72;
            scores[1] = 73;
            scores[2] = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %i\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / N);
        }
        
    
    *   We can use the `const` keyword to tell the compiler that the value of `N` should never be changed by our program. And by convention, we’ll place our declaration of the variable outside of the `main` function and capitalize its name, which isn’t necessary for the compiler but shows other humans that this variable is a constant and makes it easy to see from the start.
*   With an array, we can collect our scores in a loop, and access them later in a loop, too:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        float average(int length, int array[]);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get number of scores
            int n = get_int("Scores:  ");
        
            // Get scores
            int scores[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                scores[i] = get_int("Score %i: ", i + 1);
            }
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %.1f\n", average(n, scores));
        }
        
        float average(int length, int array[])
        {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
            {
                sum += array[i];
            }
            return (float) sum / (float) length;
        }
        
    
    *   First, we’ll ask the user for the number of scores they have, create an array with enough `int`s for the number of scores they have, and use a loop to collect all the scores.
    *   Then we’ll write a helper function, `average`, to return a `float`, or a decimal value. We’ll pass in the length and an array of `int`s (which could be any size), and use another loop inside our helper function to add up the values into a sum. We use `(float)` to cast both `sum` and `length` into floats, so the result we get from dividing the two is also a float.
    *   Finally, when we print the result we get, we use `%.1f` to show just one place after the decimal.
*   In memory, our array is now stored like this, where each value takes up not one but four bytes:  
    ![grid with 72 labeled score1, 73 labeled score2, 33 labeled score3, each of which takes up four boxes, and many empty boxes following](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/memory_with_array.png)
