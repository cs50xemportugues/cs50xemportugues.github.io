Spreadsheets
------------

*   Most of us are familiar with spreadsheets, rows of data, with each column in a row having a different piece of data that relate to each other somehow.
*   A database is an application that can store data, and we can think of Google Sheets as one such application.
*   For example, we created a Google Form to ask students their favorite TV show and genre of it. We look thorugh the responses, and see that the spreadsheet has three columns: “Timestamp”, “title”, and “genres”:  
    ![image of Google Sheets spreadsheet with row 1 having cells "Timestamp", "title", and "genres", with row 2 having cells "10/28/2019 15:03:45", "Dynasty", "Drama, Family", and so on](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/7/spreadsheet.png)
*   We can download a CSV file from the spreadsheet with “File > Download”, upload it to our IDE, and see that it’s a text file with comma-separated values matching the spreadsheet’s data.
*   We’ll write `favorites.py`:
    
        import csv
        
        with open("CS50 2019 - Lecture 7 - Favorite TV Shows (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv", "r") as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            for row in reader:
                print(row["title"])
        
    
    *   We’re just going to open the file and make sure we can get the title of each row.
*   Now we can use a dictionary to count the number of times we’ve seen each title, with the keys being the titles and the values for each key an integer, tracking how many times we’ve seen that title:
    
        import csv
        
        counts = {}
        
        with open("CS50 2019 - Lecture 7 - Favorite TV Shows (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv", "r") as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            for row in reader:
                title = row["title"]
                if title in counts:
                    counts[title] += 1
                else:
                    counts[title] = 1
        
        for title, count in counts.items():
            print(title, count, sep=" | ")
        
    
    *   In each row, we can get the `title` with `row["title"]`.
    *   Here, if we’ve seen the title before (it’s in `counts`), we can just add 1 to the value. Otherwise, we need to set the initial value to 1.
    *   Finally, we can print out our dictionary’s keys and values with a separator so it’s a bit easier to read.
*   We can change the way we iterate to `for title, count in sorted(counts.items()):`, and we’ll see our dictionary sorted by the keys, alphabetically.
*   But we can sort by the key-value pairs in the dictionary with:
    
        def f(item):
          return item[1]
        
        for title, count in sorted(counts.items(), key=f, reverse=True):
        
    
    *   We define a function, `f`, which just returns the value from the `item` in the dictionary with `item[1]`. The `sorted` function, in turn, can use that as the key to sort the dictionary’s items. And we’ll also pass in `reverse=True` to sort from largest to smallest, instead of smallest to largest.
*   We can actually define our function in the same line, with this syntax:
    
        for title, count in sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True):
        
    
    *   We pass in a lambda, or anonymous function, as the key, which takes in the `item` and returns `item[1]`.
*   Finally, we can make all the titles lowercase with `title = row["title"].lower()`, so our counts can be a little more accurate even if the names weren’t typed in the exact same way.
