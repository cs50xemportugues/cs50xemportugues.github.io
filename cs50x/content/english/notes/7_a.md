Welcome!
--------

*   In previous weeks, we introduced you to Python, a high-level programming language that utilized the same building blocks we learned in C.
*   This week, we will be continuing more syntax related to Python.
*   Further, we will be integrating this knowledge with data.
*   Finally, we will be discussing _SQL_ or _Structured Query Language_.
*   Overall, one of the goals of this course is to learn to program generally – not simply how to program in the languages described in this course.

Flat-File Database
------------------

*   As you have likely seen before, data can often be described in patterns of columns and tables.
*   Spreadsheets like those created in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets can be outputted to a `csv` or _comma-separated values_ file.
*   If you look at a `csv` file, you’ll notice that the file is flat in that all of our data is stored in a single table represented by a text file. We call this form of data a _flat-file database_.
*   Python comes with native support for `csv` files.
*   In your terminal window, type `code favorites.py` and write code as follows:
    
        # Prints all favorites in CSV using csv.reader
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create reader
            reader = csv.reader(file)
        
            # Skip header row
            next(reader)
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, printing each favorite
            for row in reader:
                print(row[1])
        
    
    Notice that the `csv` library is imported. Further, we created a `reader` that will hold the result of `csv.reader(file)`. The `csv.reader` function reads each row from the file, and in our code we store the results in `reader`. `print(row[1])`, therefore, will print the language from the `favorites.csv` file.
    
*   You can improve your code as follows:
    
        # Stores favorite in a variable
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create reader
            reader = csv.reader(file)
        
            # Skip header row
            next(reader)
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, printing each favorite
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row[1]
                print(favorite)
        
    
    Notice that `favorite` is stored and then printed. Also notice that we use the `next` function to skip to the next line of our reader.
    
*   Python also allows you to index by the keys of a list. Modify your code as follows:
    
        # Prints all favorites in CSV using csv.DictReader
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, printing each favorite
            for row in reader:
                print(row["language"])
        
    
    Notice that this example directly utilizes the `language` key in the print statement.
