Selection sort
--------------

*   We can take another approach with the same set of numbers:
    
        6 3 8 5 2 7 4 1
        
    
*   First, we’ll look at each number, and remember the smallest one we’ve seen. Then, we can swap it with the first number in our list, since we know it’s the smallest:
    
        6 3 8 5 2 7 4 1
        –             –
        1 3 8 5 2 7 4 6
        
    
*   Now we know at least the first element of our list is in the right place, so we can look for the smallest element among the rest, and swap it with the next unsorted element (now the second element):
    
        1 3 8 5 2 7 4 6
          –     –
        1 2 8 5 3 7 4 6
        
    
*   We can repeat this over and over, until we have a sorted list.
*   This algorithm is called **selection sort**, and we might write pseudocode like this:
    
        For i from 0 to n–1
            Find smallest item between i'th item and last item
            Swap smallest item with i'th item
        
    
*   With big _O_ notation, we still have running time of _O_(_n_2), since we were looking at roughly all _n_ elements to find the smallest, and making _n_ passes to sort all the elements.
*   More formally, we can use some formulas to show that the biggest factor is indeed _n_2:
    
        n + (n – 1) + (n – 2) + ... + 1
        n(n + 1)/2
        (n^2 + n)/2
        n^2/2 + n/2
        O(n^2)
        
    
*   So it turns out that selection sort is fundamentally about the same as bubble sort in running time:
    *   _O_(_n_2)
        *   bubble sort, selection sort
    *   _O_(_n_ log _n_)
    *   _O_(_n_)
        *   linear search
    *   _O_(log _n_)
        *   binary search
    *   _O_(1)
*   The best case, Ω, is also _n_2.
*   We can go back to bubble sort and change its algorithm to be something like this, which will allow us to stop early if all the elements are sorted:
    
        Repeat until no swaps
            For i from 0 to n–2
                If i'th and i+1'th elements out of order
                    Swap them
        
    
    *   Now, we only need to look at each element once, so the best case is now Ω(_n_):
        *   Ω(_n_2)
            *   selection sort
        *   Ω(_n_ log _n_)
        *   Ω(_n_)
            *   bubble sort
        *   Ω(log _n_)
        *   Ω(1)
            *   linear search, binary search
*   We look at a visualization online [comparing sorting algorithms](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) with animations for how the elements move within arrays for both bubble sort and selection sort.
