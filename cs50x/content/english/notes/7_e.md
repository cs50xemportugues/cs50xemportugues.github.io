----

*   IMDb offers a database of people, shows, writers, starts, genres, and ratings. Each of these tables is related to one another as follows:
    
    ![six boxes that represent various sql tables arrows are drawn to each showing their many relationships with one another](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/7/cs50Week7Slide025.png "imdb relationships")
    
*   After downloading [`shows.db`](https://github.com/cs50/lectures/blob/2022/fall/7/src7/imdb/shows.db), you can execute `sqlite3 shows.db` in your terminal window.
*   Upon executing `.schema` you will find not only each of the tables but the individual fields inside each of these fields.
*   As you can see by the image above, `shows` has an `id` field. The `genres` table has a `show_id` field which has data that is common between it and the `shows` table.
*   As you can see also in the image above, `show_id` exists in all of the tables. In the `shows` table, it is simply called `id`. This common field between all the fields is called a _key_. Primary keys are used to identify a unique record in a table. _Foreign keys_ are used to build relationships between tables by pointing to the primary key in another table.
*   By storing data in a relational database, as above, data can be more efficiently stored.
*   In _sqlite_, we have five datatypes, including:
    
          BLOB       -- binary large objects that are groups of ones and zeros
          INTEGER    -- an integer
          NUMERIC    -- for numbers that are formatted specially like dates
          REAL       -- like a float
          TEXT       -- for strings and the like
        
    
*   Additionally, columns can be set to add special constraints:
    
          NOT NULL
          UNIQUE
        
    
*   To illustrate the relationship between these tables further, we could execute the following command: `SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 10;`. Examining the output, we could execute `SELECT * FROM shows LIMIT 10;`. Further, we could execute `SELECT * FROM stars LIMIT 10;`. `show_id` is a foreign key in this final query because `show_id` corresponds to the unique `id` field in `shows`. `person_id` corresponds to the unique `id` field in the `people` column.
*   We can further play with this data to understand these relationships. Execute `SELECT * FROM genres;`. There are a lot of genres!
*   We can further limit this data down by executing `SELECT * FROM genres WHERE genre = 'Comedy' LIMIT 10;`. From this query, you can see that there are 10 shows presented.
*   You can discover what shows these are by executing `SELECT * FROM shows WHERE id = 626124;`
*   We can further our query to be more efficient by executing
    
        SELECT title
        FROM shows
        WHERE id IN (
            SELECT *
            FROM genres
            WHERE genre = 'Comedy'
        )
        LIMIT 10;
        
    
    Notice that this query nests together two queries. An inner query is used by an outer query.
    
*   We can refine further by executing
    
        SELECT title
        FROM shows
        WHERE id IN (
            SELECT *
            FROM genres
            WHERE genre = 'Comedy'
        )
        ORDER BY title LIMIT 10;
        
    
*   What if you wanted to find all shows in which Steve Carell stars? You could execute `SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = 'Steve Carell';` You would find his individual `id`. You could utilize this `id` to locate many `shows` in which he appears. However, this would be tedious to attempt this one by one. How could we next our queries to make this more streamlined? Consider the following:
    
        SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN
          (SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id =
            (SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = 'Steve Carell'));
        
    
    Notice that this lengthy query will result in a final result that is useful in discovering the answer to our question.
    

`JOIN`s
-------

*   Consider the following two tables:
    
    ![two boxes representing the shows and genres table with an arrow connecting id and show id](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/7/cs50Week7Slide030.png "primary and foreign keys")
    
*   How could we combine tables temporarily? Tables could be joined together using the `JOIN` command.
*   Execute the following command:
    
        SELECT * FROM shows
          JOIN ratings on shows.id = ratings.show_id
          WHERE title = 'The Office';
        
    
*   Now you can see all the shows that have been called _The Office_.
*   You could similarly apply `JOIN` to our Steve Carell query above by executing the following:
    
        SELECT title FROM people
          JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id
          JOIN shows ON stars.show_id = shows.id
          WHERE name = `Steve Carell`;
        
    
    Notice how each `JOIN` command tells us which columns are aligned to each which other columns.
    
*   This could be similarly implemented as follows:
    
        SELECT title FROM people, stars, shows
        WHERE people.id = stars.person_id
        AND stars.show_id = shows.id
        AND name = 'Steve Carell';
        
    
    Notice that this achieves the same results.
    
*   The wildcard `%` operator can be used to find all people whose names start with `Steve C` one could employ the syntax `SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE 'Steve C%';`.
