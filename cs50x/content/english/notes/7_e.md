*   In fact, we can combine both tables with `SELECT * FROM shows WHERE id IN (SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre = "Comedy") AND year = 2019;`. We’re filtering our `shows` table by IDs where the ID in the `genres` table has a value of “Comedy” for the `genre` column, and has the value of 2019 for the `year` column.
*   Our tables look like this:  
    ![table labeled shows with entries id, title, and year, and table labeled genres with show_id and genre and arrow from show_id to id](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/7/shows_table_genres_table.png)
    *   Since the ID in the `genre` table come from the `shows` table, we call it `show_id`. And the arrow indicates that a single show ID might have many matching rows in the `genres` table.
*   We see that some datasets from IMDb, like `title.principals.tsv`, have only IDs for certain columns that we’ll have to look up in other tables.
*   By reading the descriptions for each table, we can see that all of the data can be used to construct these tables:  
    ![table labeled people, shows, genres, ratings, stars, writers with arrows indicating IDs between tables](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/7/imdb_tables.png)
    *   Notice that, for example, a person’s name could also be copied to the `stars` or `writers` tables, but instead only the `person_id` is used to link to the data in the `people` table. This way, we only need to update the name in one place if we need to make a change.
*   We’ll open a database, `shows.db`, with these tables to look at some more examples.
*   We’ll download a program called [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/), which will have a graphical user interface to browse our tables and data. We can use the “Execute SQL” tab to run SQL directly in the program, too.
*   We can run `SELECT * FROM shows JOIN genres ON show.id = genres.show_id;` to join two tables by matching IDs in columns we specify. Then we’ll get back a wider table, with columns from each of those two tables.
*   We can take a person’s ID and find them in shows with `SELECT * FROM stars WHERE person_id = 1122;`, but we can do a query inside our query with `SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = "Ellen DeGeneres");`.
*   This gives us back the `show_id`, so to get the show data we can run: `SELECT * FROM shows WHERE id IN (...);` with `...` being the query above.
*   We can get the same results with:
    
        SELECT title FROM
        people JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id JOIN
        shows ON stars.show_id = shows.id
        WHERE name = "Ellen DeGeneres"
        
    
    *   We join the `people` table with the `stars` table, and then with the `shows` table by specifying columns that should match between the tables, and then selecting just the `title` with a filter on the name.
    *   But now we can select other fields from our combined tables, too.
*   It turns out that we can specify columns of our tables to be special types, such as:
    *   `PRIMARY KEY`, used as the primary identifier for a row
    *   `FOREIGN KEY`, which points to a row in another table
    *   `UNIQUE`, which means it has to be unique in this table
    *   `INDEX`, which asks our database to create a index to more quickly query based on this column. An index is a data structure like a tree, which helps us search for values.
*   We can create an index with `CREATE INDEX person_index ON stars (person_id);`. Then the `person_id` column will have an index called `person_index`. With the right indexes, our join query is several hundred times faster.
