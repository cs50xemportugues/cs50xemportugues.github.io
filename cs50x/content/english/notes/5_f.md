Trees
-----

*   _Binary search trees_ are another data structure that can be used to store data more efficiently such that it can be searched and retrieved.
*   You can imagine a sorted sequence of numbers.

*   Imagine then that the center value becomes the top of a tree. Those that are less than this value are placed to the left. Those values that are more than this value are to the right.
    
    ![1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in boxes arranged in a heirarchy 4 is at the top 3 and 5 are below that and 1 2 6 7 are below those](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide119.png "tree")
    
*   Pointers can then be used to point to the correct location of each area of memory such that each of these nodes can be connected.

*   In code, this can be implemented as follows.
    
        // Implements a list of numbers as a binary search tree
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        // Represents a node
        typedef struct node
        {
            int number;
            struct node *left;
            struct node *right;
        }
        node;
        
        void free_tree(node *root);
        void print_tree(node *root);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Tree of size 0
            node *tree = NULL;
        
            // Add number to list
            node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
            if (n == NULL)
            {
                return 1;
            }
            n->number = 2;
            n->left = NULL;
            n->right = NULL;
            tree = n;
        
            // Add number to list
            n = malloc(sizeof(node));
            if (n == NULL)
            {
                free_tree(tree);
                return 1;
            }
            n->number = 1;
            n->left = NULL;
            n->right = NULL;
            tree->left = n;
        
            // Add number to list
            n = malloc(sizeof(node));
            if (n == NULL)
            {
                free_tree(tree);
                return 1;
            }
            n->number = 3;
            n->left = NULL;
            n->right = NULL;
            tree->right = n;
        
            // Print tree
            print_tree(tree);
        
            // Free tree
            free_tree(tree);
            return 0;
        }
        
        void free_tree(node *root)
        {
            if (root == NULL)
            {
                return;
            }
            free_tree(root->left);
            free_tree(root->right);
            free(root);
        }
        
        void print_tree(node *root)
        {
            if (root == NULL)
            {
                return;
            }
            print_tree(root->left);
            printf("%i\n", root->number);
            print_tree(root->right);
        }
        
    
*   Searching this tree could be implemented as follows:
    
        bool search(node *tree, int number)
        {
            if (tree == NULL)
            {
                return false;
            }
            else if (number < tree->number)
            {
                return search(tree->left, number);
            }
            else if (number > tree->number)
            {
                return search(tree->right, number);
            }
            else if (number == tree->number)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice this search function begins by going to the location of `tree`. Then, it uses recursion to search for `number`.
    
*   A tree like the above offers dynamism that an array does not offer. It can grow and shrink as we wish.
