Welcome!
--------

*   All the prior weeks have presented you with the fundamental building blocks of programming.
*   All you have learned in C will enable you to implement these building blocks in higher-level programming languages such as Python.
*   Today, we are going to talk about organizing data in memory.

Data Structures
---------------

*   _Data structures_ essentially are forms of organization in memory.
*   There are many ways to organize data in memory.
*   _Abstract data structures_ are those that we can conceptually imagine. When learning about computer science, it’s often useful to begin with these conceptual data structures. Learning these will make it easier later to understand how to implement more concrete data structures.

Stacks and Queues
-----------------

*   _Queues_ are one form of abstract data structure.
*   Queues have specific properties. Namely, they are _FIFO_ or “first in first out.” You can imagine yourself in a line for a ride at an amusement park. The first person in the line gets to go on the ride first. The last person gets to go on the ride last.
*   Queues have specific actions associated with them. For example, an item can be _enqueued_; that is, the item can join the line or queue. Further, an item can be _dequeued_ or leave the queue once it reaches the front of the line.
*   Queues contrast a _stack_. Fundamentally, the properties of a stack are different than a queue. Specifically, it is _LIFO_ or “last in first out.” Just like stacking trays in a cafeteria, a tray that is placed in a stack last is the first that may be picked up.
*   Stacks have specific actions associated with them. For example, _push_ places something on top of a stack. _Pop_ is removing something from the top of the stack.
*   In code, you might imagine a stack as follows:
    
        const int CAPACITY = 50;
        
        typedef struct
        {
            person people[CAPACITY];
            int size;
        }
        stack;
        
    
    Notice that an array called people is of type `person`. The `CAPACITY` is how high the stack could be. The integer `size` is how full the stack actually is, regardless of how much it _could_ hold.
    
*   You might imagine that the above code has a limitation. Since the capacity of the array is always predetermined in this code. Therefore, the stack may always be oversized. You might imagine only using one place in the stack out of 5000.
*   It would be nice for our stack to be dynamic – able to grow as items are added to it.
