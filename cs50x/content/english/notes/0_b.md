Computational Thinking
----------------------

*   Essentially, computer programming is about taking some input and creating some output - thus solving a problem. What happens in between the input and output, what we could call _a black box,_ is the focus of this course.

*   For example, we may need to take attendance for a class. We could use a system called _unary_ to count, one finger at a time. Computers today count using a system called _binary_. It’s from the term _binary digit_ that we get a familiar term called _bit_. A _bit_ is a zero or one.
*   Computers only speak in terms of zeros and ones. Zeros represent _off._ Ones represent _on._ Computers are millions, and perhaps billions, of transistors that are being turned on and off.
*   If you imagine using a light bulb, a single bulb can only count from zero to one.
*   However, if you were to have three light bulbs, there are more options open to you!
*   Using three light bulbs, the following could represent zero:
    
          0 0 0
        
    
*   Similarly, the following would represent one:
    
          0 0 1
        
    
*   By this logic, we could propose that the following equals two:
    
          0 1 0
        
    
*   Extending this logic further, the following represents three:
    
          0 1 1
        
    
*   Four would appear as:
    
          1 0 0
        
    
*   We could, in fact, using only three light bulbs count as high as seven!
    
          1 1 1
        
    
*   As a heuristic, we could imagine that the following values represent each possible place in our _binary digit_:
    
          4 2 1
        
    
*   Computers use ‘base-2’ to count. This can be pictured as follows:
    
          2^2  2^1  2^0
          4    2    1
        
    
*   Therefore, you could say that it would require three bits (the four’s place, the two’s place, and the one’s place) to represent a number as high as seven.
    
*   Computers generally use eight bits to represent a number. For example, `00000101` is the number 5 in _binary_.

Text
----

*   Just as numbers are binary patterns of ones and zeros, letters are represented using ones and zeros too!
*   Since there is an overlap between the ones and zeros that represent numbers and letters, the _ASCII_ standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.
*   For example, the letter `A` was decided to map to the number 65.
*   If you received a text message, the binary under that message might represent the numbers 72, 73, and 33. Mapping these out to ASCII, your message would look as follows:
    
          H   I   !
          72  73  33
        
    
*   Thank goodness for standards like ASCII that allow us to agree upon these values!
*   Here is an expanded map of ASCII values:
