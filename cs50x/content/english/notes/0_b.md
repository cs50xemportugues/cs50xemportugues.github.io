What is computer science?
-------------------------

*   Computer science is fundamentally problem-solving.
*   We can think of problem-solving as the process of taking some input (details about our problem) and generate some output (the solution to our problem). The “black box” in the middle is computer science.

*   We need a way to represent inputs, such that we can store and work with information in a standard way.

Binary
------

*   A computer, at the lowest level, stores data in binary, a numeral system in which there are just two digits, 0 and 1.
*   When we first learned to count, we might have used one finger to represent one thing. That system is called unary. When we learned to write numbers with the digits 0 through 9, we learned to use decimal.
*   For example, we know the following represents one hundred and twenty-three.
    
    1 2 3
    
    *   The `3` is in the ones column, the `2` is in the tens column, and the `1` is in the hundreds column.
    *   So `123` is 100×1 + 10×2 + 1×3 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123.
    *   Each place for a digit represents a power of ten, since there are ten possible digits for each place.
*   In binary, with just two digits, we have powers of two for each place value:
    
    4 2 1
    **0 0 0**
    
    *   This would still be equal to 0.
*   Now if we change the binary value to, say, `0 1 1`, the decimal value would be 3.
    
    4 2 1
    **0 1 1**
    
*   If we wanted to represent 8, we would need another digit:
    
    8 4 2 1
    **1 0 0 0**
    
*   And binary makes sense for computers because we power them with electricity, which can be either on or off, so each bit only needs to be on or off. In a computer, there are millions or billions of switches called transistors that can store electricity and represent a bit by being “on” or “off”.
*   With enough bits, or binary digits, computers can count to any number.
*   8 bits make up one **byte**.
