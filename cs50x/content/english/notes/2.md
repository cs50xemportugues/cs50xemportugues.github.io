Welcome!
--------

*   In our previous session, we learned about C, a text-based programming language.
*   This week, we are going to take a deeper look at additional building-blocks that will support our goals of learning more about programming from the bottom up.
*   Fundamentally, in addition to the essentials of programming, this course is about problem-solving. Accordingly, we will also focus further on how to approach computer science problems.

Compiling
---------

*   _Encryption_ is the act of hiding plain text from prying eyes. _decrypting_, then, is the act of taking an encrypted piece of text and returning it to a human-readable form.
*   An encrypted piece of text may look like the following:
    
    ![encryption](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide008.png "encryption")
    
*   Recall that last week you learned about a _compiler_, a specialized computer program that converts _source code_ into _machine code_ that can be understood by a computer.
*   For example, you might have a computer program that looks like this:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
*   A compiler will take the above code and turn it into the following machine code:
    
    ![machine code](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide012.png "machine code")
    
*   _VS Code_, the programming environment provided to you as a CS50 student, utilizes a compiler called `clang` or _c language_.
*   If you were to type `make hello`, it runs a command that executes clang to create an output file that you can run as a user.
*   VS Code has been pre-programmed such that `make` will run numerous command line arguments along with clang for your convenience as a user.
*   Consider the following code:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }
        
    
*   You can attempt to enter into the terminal window: `clang -o hello hello.c`. You will be met by an error that indicates that clang does not know where to find the `cs50.h` library.
*   Attempting again to compile this code, run the following command in the terminal window: `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50`. This will enable the compiler to access the `cs50.h` library.
*   Running in the terminal window `./hello`, your program will run as intended.
*   While the above is offered as an illustration, such that you can understand more deeply the process and concept of compiling code, using `make` in CS50 is perfectly fine and the expectation!
*   Compiling involves major steps, including the following:

*   First, _preprocessing_ is where the header files in your code, designated by a `#` (such as `#include \<cs50.h\>`) are effectively copied and pasted into your file. During this step, the code from `cs50.h` is copied into your program. Similarly, just as your code contains `#include \<stdio.h\>`, code contained within `stdio.h` somewhere on your computer is copied to your program. This step can be visualized as follows: 

        ...
        string get_string(string prompt);
        int printf(string format, ...);
        ...

        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }


* Second, _compiling_ is where your program is converted into assembly code. This step can be visualized as follows: ![compiling](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide033.png "compiling")
        
*   Third, _assembling_ involves the compiler converting your assembly code into machine code. This step can be visualized as follows: ![assembling](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide038.png "assembling")
        
*   Finally, during the _linking_ step, code from your included libraries are converted also into machine code and combined with your code. The final executable file is then outputted. ![linking](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide049.png "linking")
        

Debugging
---------

*   Everyone will make mistakes while coding.
*   Consider the following image from last week:
    
    ![mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide061.png "mario")
    
*   Further, consider the following code that has a bug purposely inserted within it:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
            {
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   Type `code buggy0.c` into the terminal window and write the above code.
*   Running this code, four bricks appear instead of the intended three.
*   `printf` is a very useful way of debugging your code. You could modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
            {
                printf("i is %i\n", i);
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   Running this code, you will see numerous statements, including `i is 0`, `i is 1`, `i is 2`, and `i is 3`. Seeing this, you might realize that Further code needs to be corrected as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice the `<=` has been replaced with `<`.
    
*   A second tool in debugging is called a _debugger_, a software tool created by programmers to help track down bugs in code.
*   In VS Code, a preconfigured debugger has been provided to you.
*   To utilize this debugger, first set a _breakpoint_ by clicking to the left of a line of your code, just to the left of the line number. When you click there, you will see a red dot appearing. Imagine this as a stop sign, asking the compiler to pause such that you can consider what’s happening in this part of your code.
    
    ![break point](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Debugging.png "break point")
    
*   Second, run `debug50 ./buggy0`. You will notice that after the debugger comes to life that a line of your code will illuminate in a gold-like color. Quite literally, the code has _paused_ at this line of code. Notice in the top left corner how all local variables are being displayed, including `i`, which has a current value of `0`. At the top of your window, you can click the `step over` button and it will keep moving through your code. Notice how the value of `i` increases.
*   While this tool will not show you where your bug is, it will help you slow down and see how your code is running step by step.
    
*   To illustrate a third means of debugging, please start a new file by running `code buggy1.c` in your terminal window. Write your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int get_negative_int(void);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = get_negative_int();
            printf("%i\n", i);
        }
        
        // Prompt user for positive integer
        int get_negative_int(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Negative Integer: ");
            }
            while (n < 0);
            return n;
        }
        
    
    Notice `get_negative_int` is designed to get a negative integer from the user.
    
*   Running `make buggy1`, you’ll notice that it does not do as intended. It accepts positive integers and seems to ignore negative ones.
*   As before, set a breakpoint at a line of your code. Best to set a breakpoint at `int i = get_negative_int`. Now, run `debug50 buggy1`.
*   Unlike before, where you utilized the `step over` button at the top of the window, use the `step into` button. This will take the debugger into your `get_negative_int` function. Notice how doing this will show you that you are, indeed, stuck in the `do while` loop.
*   With this knowledge, you might consider why you are stuck in this loop, leading you to edit your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int get_negative_int(void);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = get_negative_int();
            printf("%i\n", i);
        }
        
        // Prompt user for positive integer
        int get_negative_int(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Negative Integer: ");
            }
            while (n >= 0);
            return n;
        }
        
    
    Notice `n < 0` has been changed.
    
*   A final form of debugging is called _rubber duck debugging_. When you are having challenges with your code, consider how speaking out loud to, quite literally, a rubber duck about the code problem. If you’d rather not talk to a small plastic duck, you are welcome to speak to a human near you! They need not understand how to program: Speaking with them is an opportunity for you to speak about your code.

Arrays
------

*   In Week 0, we talked about _data types_ such as `bool`, `int`, `char`, `string`, etc.
*   Each data type requires a certain amount of system resources:
    *   `bool` 1 byte
    *   `int` 4 bytes
    *   `long` 8 bytes
    *   `float` 4 bytes
    *   `double` 8 bytes
    *   `char` 1 byte
    *   `string` ? bytes
*   Inside of your computer, you have a finite amount of memory available.
    
    ![memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide084.png "memory")
    
*   Physically, on the memory of your computer, you can imagine how specific types of data are stored on your computer. You might imagine that a `char`, which only requires 1 byte of memory, may look as follows:
    
    ![1 byte](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide087.png "1 byte")
    
*   Similarly, an `int`, which requires 4 bytes might look as follows:
    
    ![4 bytes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide088.png "4 bytes")
    
*   We can create a program that explores these concepts. Inside your terminal, type `code scores.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int score1 = 72;
            int score2 = 73;
            int score3 = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3.0);
        }
        
    
    Notice that the number on the right is a floating point value of `3.0`, such that the calculation is rendered as a floating point value in the end.
    
*   Running `make scores`, the program runs.
*   You can imagine how these variables are stored in memory:
    
    ![scores in memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide098.png "scores in memory")
    
*   _Arrays_ are a way of storing data back-to-back in memory such that this data is easily accessible.
*   `int scores[3]` is a way of telling the compiler to provide you three back-to-back places in memory of size `int` to store three `scores`. Considering our program, you can revise your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Scores
            int scores[3];
            scores[0] = 72;
            scores[1] = 73;
            scores[2] = 33;
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / 3.0);
        }
        
    
    Notice that `score[0]` examines the value at this location of memory by `indexing into` the array called `scores` at location `0` to see what value is stored there.
    
*   You can see how while the above code works, there is still an opportunity for improving our code. Revise your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get scores
            int scores[3];
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
            }
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / 3.0);
        }
        
    
    Notice how we index into `scores` by using `scores[i]` where `i` is supplied by the `for` loop.
    
*   We can simplify or _abstract away_ the calculation of the average. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        // Constant
        const int N = 3;
        
        // Prototype
        float average(int length, int array[]);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get scores
            int scores[N];
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            {
                scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
            }
        
            // Print average
            printf("Average: %f\n", average(N, scores));
        }
        
        float average(int length, int array[])
        {
            // Calculate average
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
            {
                sum += array[i];
            }
            return sum / (float) length;
        }
        
    
    Notice that a new function called `average` is declared. Further, notice that a `const` or constant value of `N` is declared. Most importantly, notice how the `average` function takes `int array[]`, which means that the compiler passes an array to this function.
    
*   Not only can arrays be containers: They can be passed between functions.

Strings
-------

*   A `string` is simply an array of variables of type `char`: an array of characters.
*   Considering the following image, you can see how a string is an array of characters that begins with the first character and ends with a special character called a `NUL character`:
    
    ![hi with terminator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide116.png "hi with terminator")
    
*   Imagining this in decimal, your array would look like the following:
    
    ![hi with decimal](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide117.png "hi with decimal")
    
*   Implementing this in your own code, type `code hi.c` in the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char c1 = 'H';
            char c2 = 'I';
            char c3 = '!';
        
            printf("%i %i %i\n", c1, c2, c3);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this will output the decimal values of each character.
    
*   To further understand how a `string` works, revise your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = "HI!";
            printf("%i %i %i\n", s[0], s[1], s[2]);
        }
        
    
    Notice how the `printf` statement presents three values from our array called `s`.
    
*   Let’s imagine we want to say both `HI!` and `BYE!`. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = "HI!";
            string t = "BYE!";
        
            printf("%s\n", s);
            printf("%s\n", t);
        }
        
    
    Notice that two strings are declared and used in this example.
    
*   You can visualize this as follow:
    
    ![hi and bye](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide126.png "hi and bye")
    
*   We can further improve this code. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string words[2];
        
            words[0] = "HI!";
            words[1] = "BYE!";
        
            printf("%s\n", words[0]);
            printf("%s\n", words[1]);
        }
        
    
    Notice that both strings are stored within a single array of type `string`.
    
*   A common problem within programming, and perhaps C more specifically, is to discover the length of an array. How could we implement this in code? Type `code length.c` in the terminal window and code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt for user's name
            string name = get_string("Name: ");
        
            // Count number of characters up until '\0' (aka NUL)
            int n = 0;
            while (name[n] != '\0')
            {
                n++;
            }
            printf("%i\n", n);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code loops until the `NUL` character is found.
    
*   Since this is such a common problem within programming, other programmers have created code in the `string.h` library to find the length of a string. You can find the length of a string by modifying your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt for user's name
            string name = get_string("Name: ");
            int length = strlen(name);
            printf("%i\n", length);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code uses the `string.h` library, declared at the top of the file. Further, it uses a function from that library called `strlen`, which calculates the length of the string passed to it.
    
*   `ctype.h` is another library that is quite useful. Imagine we wanted to create a program that converted all lowercase characters to uppercase ones. In the terminal window type `code uppercase.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("Before: ");
            printf("After:  ");
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
            {
                if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
                {
                    printf("%c", s[i] - 32);
                }
                else
                {
                    printf("%c", s[i]);
                }
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code _iterates_ through each value in the string. The program looks at each character. If the character is lowercase, it subtracts the value 32 from it to convert it to uppercase.
    
*   Recalling our previous work from last week, you might remember this ASCII values chart:
    
    ![ascii](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide120.png "ascii")
    
*   When a lowercase character has `32` subtracted from it, it results in an uppercase version of that same character.
*   While the program does what we want, there is an easier way using the `ctype.h` library. Modify your program as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <ctype.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("Before: ");
            printf("After:  ");
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
            {
                if (islower(s[i]))
                {
                    printf("%c", toupper(s[i]));
                }
                else
                {
                    printf("%c", s[i]);
                }
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice that the program uses `islower` to detect if each character is uppercase or lowercase. Then, the `toupper` function is passed `s[i]`. Each character (if lowercase) is converted to uppercase.
    
*   Again, while this program does what is desired, there is an opportunity for improvement. As the documentation for `ctype.h` states, `toupper` is smart enough to know that if it is passed what is already an uppercase letter, it will simply ignore it. Therefore, we no longer need our `if` statement. You can simplify this code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <ctype.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("Before: ");
            printf("After:  ");
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
            {
                printf("%c", toupper(s[i]));
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code is quite simplified, removing the unnecessary `if` statement.
    
*   You can read about all the capabilities of the `ctype` library on the [Manual Pages](https://manual.cs50.io/#ctype.h).

Command-Line Arguments
----------------------

*   `Command-line arguments` are those arguments that are passed to your program at the command line. For example, all those statements you typed after `clang` are considered command line arguments. You can use these arguments in your own programs!
*   In your terminal window, type `code greet.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this says `hello` to the user.
    
*   Still, would it not be nice to be able to take arguments before the program even runs? Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(int argc, string argv[])
        {
            if (argc == 2)
            {
                printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
            }
            else
            {
                printf("hello, world\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that this program knows both `argc`, the number of command line arguments, and `argv` which is an array of the characters passed as arguments at the command line.
    
*   Therefore, using the syntax of this program, executing `./greet David` would result in the program saying `hello, David`.

Exit Status
-----------

*   When a program ends, a special exit code is provided to the computer.
*   When a program exits without error, a status code of `0` is provided the computer. Often, when an error occurs that results in the program ending, a status of `1` is provided by the computer.
*   You could write a program as follows that illustrates this by typing `code status.c` and writing code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(int argc, string argv[])
        {
            if (argc != 2)
            {
                printf("Missing command-line argument\n");
                return 1;
            }
            printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
            return 0;
        }
        
    
    Notice that if you fail to provide `./status David`, you will get an exit status of `1`. However, if you do provide `./status David`, you will get an exit status of `0`.
    
*   You can imagine how you might use portions of the above program to check if a user provided the correct number of command-line arguments.

Cryptography
------------

*   Cryptography is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message.
*   `plaintext` and a `key` are provided to a `cipher`, resulting in ciphered text.
    
    ![cryptography](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide153.png "cryptography")
    
*   The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext. The cipher uses the key to make decisions about how to implement its cipher algorithm.
