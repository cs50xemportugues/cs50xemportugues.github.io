SQL
---

*   We’ll look at a new program in our terminal window, `sqlite3`, a command-line program that lets us use another language, SQL (pronounced like “sequel”).
*   We’ll run some commands to create a new database called `favorites.db` and import our CSV file into a table called “favorites”:
    
        ~/ $ sqlite3 favorites.db
        SQLite version 3.22.0 2018-01-22 18:45:57
        Enter ".help" for usage hints.
        sqlite> .mode csv
        sqlite> .import "CS50 2019 - Lecture 7 - Favorite TV Shows (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv" favorites
        
    
*   We see a `favorites.db` in our IDE after we run this, and now we can use SQL to interact with our data:
    
        sqlite> SELECT title FROM favorites;
        title
        Dynasty
        The Office
        Blindspot
        24
        Friends
        psych
        Veep
        Survivor
        ...
        
    
*   We can even sort our results:
    
        sqlite> SELECT title FROM favorites ORDER BY title;
        title
        /
        24
        9009
        Adventure Time
        Airplane Repo
        Always Sunny
        Ancient Aliens
        ...
        
    
*   And get a count of the number of times each title appears:
    
        sqlite> SELECT title, COUNT(title) FROM favorites GROUP BY title;
        title | COUNT(title)
        / | 1
        24 | 1
        9009 | 1
        Adventure Time | 1
        Airplane Repo | 1
        Always Sunny | 1
        Ancient Aliens | 1
        ...
        
    
*   We can even set the count of each title to a new variable, `n`, and order our results by that, in descending order. Then we can see the top 10 results with `LIMIT 10`:
    
        sqlite> SELECT title, COUNT(title) AS n FROM favorites GROUP BY title ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 10;
        title | n
        The Office | 30
        Friends | 20
        Game of Thrones | 20
        Breaking Bad | 14
        Black Mirror | 9
        Rick and Morty | 9
        Brooklyn Nine-Nine | 5
        Game of thrones | 5
        No | 5
        Prison Break | 5
        
    
*   SQL is a language that lets us work with a relational database, an application lets us store data and work with them more quickly than with a CSV.
*   With `.schema`, we can see how the format for the table for our data is created:
    
        sqlite> .schema
        CREATE TABLE favorites(
          "Timestamp" TEXT,
          "title" TEXT,
          "genres" TEXT
        );
        
    
*   It turns out that, when working with data, we only need four operations:
    *   `CREATE`
    *   `READ`
    *   `UPDATE`
    *   `DELETE`
*   In SQL, the commands to perform each of these operations are:
    *   `INSERT`
    *   `SELECT`
    *   `UPDATE`
    *   `DELETE`
*   First, we’ll need to insert a table with the `CREATE TABLE table (column type, ...);` command.
*   SQL, too, has its own data types to optimize the amount of space used for storing data:
    *   `BLOB`, for “binary large object”, raw binary data that might represent files
    *   `INTEGER`
        *   `smallint`
        *   `integer`
        *   `bigint`
    *   `NUMERIC`
        *   `boolean`
        *   `date`
        *   `datetime`
        *   `numeric(scale,precision)`, which solves floating-point imprecision by using as many bits as needed, for each digit before and after the decimal point
        *   `time`
        *   `timestamp`
    *   `REAL`
        *   `real`, for floating-point values
        *   `double precision`, with more bits
    *   `TEXT`
        *   `char(n)`, for an exact number of characters
        *   `varchar(n)`, for a variable number of characters, up to a certain limit
        *   `text`
*   SQLite is one database application that supports SQL, and there are many companies with server applications that support SQL, includes Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Microsoft Access.
*   After inserting values, we can use functions to perform calculations, too:
    *   `AVG`
    *   `COUNT`
    *   `DISTINCT`, for getting distinct values without duplicates
    *   `MAX`
    *   `MIN`
    *   …
*   There are also other operations we can combine as needed:
    *   `WHERE`, matching on some strict condition
    *   `LIKE`, matching on substrings for text
    *   `LIMIT`
    *   `GROUP BY`
    *   `ORDER BY`
    *   `JOIN`, combining data from multiple tables
*   We can update data with `UPDATE table SET column=value WHERE condition;`, which could include 0, 1, or more rows depending on our condition. For example, we might say `UPDATE favorites SET title = "The Office" WHERE title LIKE "%office"`, and that will set all the rows with the title containing “office” to be “The Office” so we can make them consistent.
*   And we can remove matching rows with `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;`, as in `DELETE FROM favorites WHERE title = "Friends";`.
*   We can even delete an entire table altogether with another command, `DROP`.
