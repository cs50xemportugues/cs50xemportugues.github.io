*   To count the number of favorite languages expressed in the `csv` file, we can do the following:
    
        # Counts favorites using variables
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            scratch, c, python = 0, 0, 0
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["language"]
                if favorite == "Scratch":
                    scratch += 1
                elif favorite == "C":
                    c += 1
                elif favorite == "Python":
                    python += 1
        
        # Print counts
        print(f"Scratch: {scratch}")
        print(f"C: {c}")
        print(f"Python: {python}")
        
    
    Notice that each language is counted using `if` statements.
    
*   Python allows us to use a dictionary to count the `counts` of each language. Consider the following improvement upon our code:
    
        # Counts favorites using dictionary
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["language"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        # Print counts
        for favorite in counts:
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
        
    
    Notice that the value in `counts` with the key `favorite` is incremented when it exists already. If it does not exist, we define `counts[favorite]` and set it to 1. Further, the formatted string has been improved to present the `counts[favorite]`.
    
*   Python also allows sorting `counts`. Improve your code as follows:
    
        # Sorts favorites by key
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["language"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        # Print counts
        for favorite in sorted(counts):
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
        
    
    Notice the `sorted(counts)` at the bottom of the code.
    
*   If you look at the parameters for the `sorted` function in the Python documentation, you will find it has many built-in parameters. You can leverage some of these built-in parameters as follows:
    
        # Sorts favorites by value
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["language"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        def get_value(language):
            return counts[language]
        
        # Print counts
        for favorite in sorted(counts, key=get_value, reverse=True):
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
        
    
    Notice that a function called `get_value` is created, and that the function itself is passed in as an argument to the `sorted` function. The `key` argument allows you to tell Python the method you wish to use to sort items.
    
*   Python has a unique ability that we have not seen to date: It allows for the utilization of _anonymous_ or `lambda` functions. These functions can be utilized when you want to not bother creating an entirely different function. Notice the following modification:
    
        # Sorts favorites by value using lambda function
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["language"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        # Print counts
        for favorite in sorted(counts, key=lambda language: counts[language], reverse=True):
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
        
    
    Notice that the `get_value` function has been removed. Instead, `lambda language: counts[language]` does in one line what our previous two-line function did.
