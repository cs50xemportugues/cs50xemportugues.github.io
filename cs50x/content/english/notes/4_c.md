Strings
-------

*   Now that we have a mental model for pointers, we can peel back a level of simplification that was offered earlier in this course.
*   Recall that a string is simply an array of characters. For example, `string s = "HI!"` can be represented as follows:
    
    ![The string HI with an exclaimation point stored in memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide085.png "hi")
    
*   However, what is `s` really? Where is the `s` stored in memory? As you can imagine, `s` needs to be stored somewhere. You can visualize the relationship of `s` to the string as follows:
    
    ![Same string HI with a pointer pointing to it](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide086.png "hi pointer")
    
    Notice how a pointer called `s` tells the compiler where the first byte of the string exists in memory.
    
*   Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = "HI!";
            printf("%p\n", s);
            printf("%p\n", &s[0]);
            printf("%p\n", &s[1]);
            printf("%p\n", &s[2]);
            printf("%p\n", &s[3]);
        }
        
    
    Notice the above prints the memory locations of each character in the string `s`.
    
*   Likewise, you can modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s = "HI!";
            printf("%s\n", s);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code will present the string that starts at the location of `s`.
    

Pointer Arithmetic
------------------

*   You can modify your code to accomplish the same thing in a longer form as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s = "HI!";
            printf("%c\n", s[0]);
            printf("%c\n", s[1]);
            printf("%c\n", s[2]);
        }
        
    
    Notice that we are printing each character at the location of `s`.
    
*   Further, you can modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s = "HI!";
            printf("%c\n", *s);
            printf("%c\n", *(s + 1));
            printf("%c\n", *(s + 2));
        }
        
    
    Notice that the first character at the location of `s` is printed. Then, the character at the location `s + 1` is printed, and so on.
    
*   Can you imagine what would happen if you attempted to access something at location `s + 50`? Hackers sometimes attempt to gain access to items in memory they should not have access to. If you attempt this, the program will likely quit as a safety precaution.
