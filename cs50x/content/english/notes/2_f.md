Exit Status
-----------

*   When a program ends, a special exit code is provided to the computer.
*   When a program exits without error, a status code of `0` is provided the computer. Often, when an error occurs that results in the program ending, a status of `1` is provided by the computer.
*   You could write a program as follows that illustrates this by typing `code status.c` and writing code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(int argc, string argv[])
        {
            if (argc != 2)
            {
                printf("Missing command-line argument\n");
                return 1;
            }
            printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
            return 0;
        }
        
    
    Notice that if you fail to provide `./status David`, you will get an exit status of `1`. However, if you do provide `./status David`, you will get an exit status of `0`.
    
*   You can imagine how you might use portions of the above program to check if a user provided the correct number of command-line arguments.

Cryptography
------------

*   Cryptography is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message.
*   `plaintext` and a `key` are provided to a `cipher`, resulting in ciphered text.

*   The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext. The cipher uses the key to make decisions about how to implement its cipher algorithm.

Summing Up
----------

In this lesson, you learned more details about compiling and how data is stored within a computer. Specifically, you learnedâ€¦
