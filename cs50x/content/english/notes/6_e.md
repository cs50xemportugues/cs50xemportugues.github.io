Calculator
----------

*   We can implement a simple calculator just as we did within C. Type `code calculator.py` into the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
        # Addition with int [using get_int]
        
        from cs50 import get_int
        
        # Prompt user for x
        x = get_int("x: ")
        
        # Prompt user for y
        y = get_int("y: ")
        
        # Perform addition
        print(x + y)
        
    
    Notice how the CS50 library is imported. Then, `x` and `y` are gathered from the user. Finally, the result is printed. Notice that the `main` function that would have been seen in a C program is gone entirely! While one could utilize a `main` function, it is not required.
    
*   It’s possible for one to remove the training wheels of the CS50 library. Modify your code as follows:
    
        # Addition with int [using input]
        
        # Prompt user for x
        x = input("x: ")
        
        # Prompt user for y
        y = input("y: ")
        
        # Perform addition
        print(x + y)
        
    
    Notice how executing the above code results in strange program behavior. Why might this be so?
    
*   You may have guessed that the interpreter understood `x` and `y` to be strings. You can fix your code by employing the `int` function as follows:
    
        # Addition with int [using input]
        
        # Prompt user for x
        x = int(input("x: "))
        
        # Prompt user for y
        y = int(input("y: "))
        
        # Perform addition
        print(x + y)
        
    
    Notice how the input for `x` and `y` is passed to the `int` function which converts it to an integer.
    
*   We can expand the abilities of our calculator. Modify your code as follows:
    
        # Division with integers, demonstration lack of truncation
        
        # Prompt user for x
        x = int(input("x: "))
        
        # Prompt user for y
        y = int(input("y: "))
        
        # Divide x by y
        z = x / y
        print(z)
        
    
    Notice that executing this code results in a value, but that if you were to see more digits after `.333333` you’d see that we are faced with _floating-point imprecision_.
    
*   We can reveal this imprecision by modifying our codes slightly:
    
        # Floating-point imprecision
        
        # Prompt user for x
        x = int(input("x: "))
        
        # Prompt user for y
        y = int(input("y: "))
        
        # Divide x by y
        z = x / y
        print(f"{z:.50f}")
        
    
    Notice that this code reveals the imprecision. Python still faces this issue, just as C does.
