Memory layout
-------------

*   Within our computer’s memory, the different types of data that need to be stored for our program are organized into different sections:  
    ![Grid with sections, from top to bottom: machine code, globals, heap (with arrow pointing downward), stack (with arrow pointing upward)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/memory_layout.png)
    *   The _machine code_ section is our compiled program’s binary code. When we run our program, that code is loaded into the “top” of memory.
    *   _Globals_ are global variables we declare in our program or other shared variables that our entire program can access.
    *   The _heap_ section is an empty area where `malloc` can get free memory from, for our program to use.
    *   The _stack_ section is used by functions in our program as they are called. For example, our `main` function is at the very bottom of the stack, and has the local variables `x` and `y`. The `swap` function, when it’s called, has its own frame, or slice, of memory that’s on top of `main`’s, with the local variables `a`, `b`, and `tmp`:  
        ![Stack section with (a, b, tmp) above (x, y)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/stack.png)
        *   Once the function `swap` returns, the memory it was using is freed for the next function call, and we lose anything we did, other than the return values, and our program goes back to the function that called `swap`.
        *   So by passing in the addresses of `x` and `y` from `main` to `swap`, we can actually change the values of `x` and `y`: ![Stack section with (a, b, tmp) above (x, y), and a pointing to x and b pointing to y](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/pointers.png)
*   By passing in the address of `x` and `y`, our `swap` function can actually work:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        void swap(int *a, int *b);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int x = 1;
            int y = 2;
        
            printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
            swap(&x, &y);
            printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
        }
        
        void swap(int *a, int *b)
        {
            int tmp = *a;
            *a = *b;
            *b = tmp;
        }
        
    
    *   The addresses of `x` and `y` are passed in from `main` to `swap`, and we use the `int *a` syntax to declare that our `swap` function takes in pointers. We save the value of `x` to `tmp` by following the pointer `a`, and then take the value of `y` by following the pointer `b`, and store that to the location `a` is pointing to (`x`). Finally, we store the value of `tmp` to the location pointed to by `b` (`y`), and we’re done.
*   If we call `malloc` too many times, we will have a **heap overflow**, where we end up going past our heap. Or, if we have too many functions being called, we will have a **stack overflow**, where our stack has too many frames of memory allocated as well. And these two types of overflow are generally known as buffer overflows, after which our program (or entire computer) might crash.

get\_int
--------

*   We can implement `get_int` ourselves with a C library function, `scanf`:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int x;
            printf("x: ");
            scanf("%i", &x);
            printf("x: %i\n", x);
        }
        
    
    *   `scanf` takes a format, `%i`, so the input is “scanned” for that format, and the address in memory where we want that input to go. But `scanf` doesn’t have much error checking, so we might not get an integer.
*   We can try to get a string the same way:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s = NULL;
            printf("s: ");
            scanf("%s", s);
            printf("s: %s\n", s);
        }
        
    
    *   But we haven’t actually allocated any memory for `s` (`s` is `NULL`, or not pointing to anything), so we might want to call `char s[5]` to allocate an array of 5 characters for our string. Then, `s` will be treated as a pointer in `scanf` and `printf`.
    *   Now, if the user types in a string of length 4 or less, our program will work safely. But if the user types in a longer string, `scanf` might be trying to write past the end of our array into unknown memory, causing our program to crash.
