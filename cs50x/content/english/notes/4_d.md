Comparing Strings
-----------------

*   A string of characters is simply an array of characters identified by its first byte.
*   Recall that last week we proposed that we could not compare two strings using the `==` operator.
*   Utilizing the `==` operator in an attempt to compare strings will attempt to compare the memory locations of the strings instead of the characters therein. Accordingly, we recommended the use of `strcmp`.
*   To illustrate this, type `code compare.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get two strings
            char *s = get_string("s: ");
            char *t = get_string("t: ");
        
            // Compare strings' addresses
            if (s == t)
            {
                printf("Same\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("Different\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Noticing that typing in `HI!` for both strings still results in the output of `Different`.
    
*   Why are these strings seemingly different? You can use the following to visualize why:

*   For clarity, you can see how the following image illustrates pointers pointing to two separate locations in memory:

*   Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get two strings
            char *s = get_string("s: ");
            char *t = get_string("t: ");
        
            // Print strings
            printf("%s\n", s);
            printf("%s\n", t);
        }
        
    
    Notice how we now have two separate strings stored likely at two separate locations.
    
*   You can see the locations of these two stored strings with a small modification:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get two strings
            char *s = get_string("s: ");
            char *t = get_string("t: ");
        
            // Print strings' addresses
            printf("%p\n", s);
            printf("%p\n", t);
        }
        
    
    Notice that the `%s` has been changed to `%p` in the print statement.
