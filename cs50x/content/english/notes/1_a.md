C
-

*   Today we’ll learn a new language, **C**: a programming language that has all the features of Scratch and more, but perhaps a little less friendly since it’s purely in text:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Though the words are new, the ideas are exactly as same as the “when green flag clicked” and “say (hello, world)” blocks in Scratch:  
        ![block labeled 'when green flag clicked', block labeled 'say (hello, world)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/when_green_flag.png)
*   Though cryptic, don’t forget that 2/3 of CS50 students have never taken CS before, so don’t be daunted! And though at first, to borrow a phrase from MIT, trying to absorb all these new concepts may feel like drinking from a fire hose, be assured that by the end of the semester we’ll be empowered by and experienced at learning and applying these concepts.
*   We can compare a lot of the constructs in C, to blocks we’ve already seen and used in Scratch. The syntax is far less important than the principles, which we’ve already been introduced to.
