Welcome!
--------

*   In our previous session, we learned about Scratch, a visual programming language.
*   Indeed, all the essential programming concepts presented in Scratch will be utilized as you learn how to program any programming language.
*   Recall that machines only understand binary. Where humans write _source code_, a list of instructions for the computer that is human readable, machines only understand what we can now call _machine code_. This machine code is a pattern of ones and zeros that produces a desired effect.
*   It turns out that we can convert _source code_ into `machine code` using a very special piece of software called a _compiler_. Today, we will be introducing you to a compiler that will allow you to convert source code in the programming language _C_ into machine code.
*   Today, in addition to learning about how to code, you will be learning about how to write good code.
*   Code can be evaluated upon three axes. First, _correctness_ refers to “does the code run as intended?” Second, _design_ refers to “how well is the code designed?” Finally, _style_ refers to “how aesthetically pleasing and consistent is the code?”

Hello World

*   The compiler that is utilized for this course is _Visual Studio Code_, affectionately referred to as , which can be accessed via that same url, or simply as \*VS Code.\*
*   One of the most important reasons we utilize VS Code is that it has all the software required for the course already pre-loaded on it. This course and the instructions herein were designed with VS Code in mind. Best always to utilize VS Code for assignments in this course.
*   You can open VS Code at [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/).
*   The compiler can be divided into a number of regions:
    
    ![IDE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/1/cs50Week1Slide017.png "IDE") Notice that there is a _file explorer_ on the left side where you can find your files. Further, notice that there is a region in the middle called a _text editor_ where you can edit your program. Finally, there is a `command line interface`, known as a _CLI_, _command line_, or _terminal window_ where we can send commands to the computer in the cloud.

<ul>
  <li>We can build your first program in C by typing <code>code hello.c</code> into the terminal window. Notice that we deliberately lowercased the entire filename and included the <code>.c</code> extension. Then, in the text editor that appears, write code as follows:


    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }

Note that every single character above serves a purpose. If you type it incorrectly, the program will not run.
    </li>
</ul>

*   Clicking back in the terminal window, you can compile your code by executing `make hello`. Notice that we are omitting `.c`. `make` is a compiler that will look for our `hello.c` file and turn it into a program called `hello`. If executing this command results in no errors, you can proceed. If not, double-check your code to ensure it matches the above.
*   Now, type `./hello` and your program will execute saying `hello, world`.
*   Now, open the _file explorer_ on the left. You will notice that there is now both a file called `hello.c` and another file called `hello`. `hello.c` is able to be read by the compiler: It’s where your code is stored. `hello` is an executable file that you can run, but cannot be read by the compiler.


<ul>
<li>
<p>Let’s look at our code more carefully:</p>

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }
<p>Notice that our code is highlighted using syntax highlighting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
