Scratch blocks in C
-------------------

*   The “set \[counter\] to (0)” block is creating a variable, and in C we would write `int counter = 0;`, where `int` specifies that the type of our variable is an integer:  
    ![block labeled 'set counter to (0)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/set_counter_to_0.png)
*   “change \[counter\] by (1)” is `counter = counter + 1;` in C. (In C, the `=` isn’t like an equals sign in a equation, where we are saying `counter` is the same as `counter + 1`. Instead, `=` is an assignment operator that means, “copy the value on the right, into the value on the left”.) And notice we don’t need to say `int` anymore, since we presume that we already specified previously that `counter` is an `int`, with some existing value. We can also say `counter += 1;` or `counter++;` both of which are “syntactic sugar”, or shortcuts that have the same effect with fewer characters to type.

*   A condition would map to:  
    ![block labeled 'if < (x) < (y)> then', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (x is less than y)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/if_x_y.png)
    
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Notice that in C, we use `{` and `}` (as well as indentation) to indicate how lines of code should be nested.
*   We can also have if-else conditions:  
    ![block labeled 'if < (x) < (y)> then', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (x is less than y)', parent block also has an 'else', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (x is not less than y)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/if_else.png)
    
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("x is not less than y\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Notice that lines of code that themselves are not some action (`if...`, and the braces) don’t end in a semicolon.
*   And even `else if`:
    ![block labeled 'if < (x) < (y)> then', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (x is less than y)', parent block also has an 'else', inside which is a nesting of a block labeled 'if < (x) > (y) > then', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (x is greater than y)', parent block also has an 'else', inside which there is a block labeled 'if < (x) = (y) > then', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (x is equal to y)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/if_else_if.png)
    
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else if (x > y)
        {
            printf("x is greater than y\n");
        }
        else if (x == y)
        {
            printf("x is equal to y\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Notice that, to compare two values in C, we use `==`, two equals signs.
    *   And, logically, we don’t need the `if (x == y)` in the final condition, since that’s the only case remaining, and we can just say `else`.
*   Loops can be written like the following:  
    ![block labeled 'forever', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (hello, world)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/forever.png)
    
        while (true)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
    *   The `while` keyword also requires a condition, so we use `true` as the Boolean expression to ensure that our loop will run forever. Our program will check whether the expression evaluates to `true` (which it always will in this case), and then run the lines inside the curly braces. Then it will repeat that until the expression isn’t true anymore (which won’t change in this case).
*   We could do something a certain number of times with `while`:  
    ![block labeled 'repeat (50)', inside which there is a block labeled 'say (hello, world)'](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/repeat.png)
    
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 50)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
            i++;
        }
        
    
    *   We create a variable, `i`, and set it to 0. Then, while `i < 50`, we run some lines of code, and we add 1 to `i` after each run.
    *   The curly braces around the two lines inside the `while` loop indicate that those lines will repeat, and we can add additional lines to our program after if we wanted to.
*   To do the same repetition, more commonly we can use the `for` keyword:
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Again, first we create a variable named `i` and set it to 0. Then, we check that `i < 50` every time we reach the top of the loop, before we run any of the code inside. If that expression is true, then we run the code inside. Finally, after we run the code inside, we use `i++` to add one to `i`, and the loop repeats.
