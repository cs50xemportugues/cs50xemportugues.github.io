Loops
-----

*   We can also utilize the loops building block from Scratch in our C programs.
*   In your terminal window, type `code meow.c` and write code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("meow\n");
            printf("meow\n");
            printf("meow\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice this does as intended but has an opportunity for better design.
    
*   We can improve our program by modifying your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = 0;
            while (i < 3)
            {
                printf("meow\n");
                i++;
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that we create an `int` called `i` and assign it the value `0`. Then, we create a `while` loop that will run as long as `i < 3`. Then, the loop runs. Every time `1` is added to `i` using the `i++` statement.
    
*   Similarly, we can implement a count-down of sorts by modifying our code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = 3;
            while (i > 0)
            {
                printf("meow\n");
                i--;
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice how our counter `i` is started at `3`. Each time the loop runs, it will reduce the counter by `1`. Once the counter is less than zero, it will stop the loop.
    
*   We can further improve the design using a `for` loop. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                printf("meow\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that the `for` loop includes three arguments. The first argument `int i = 0` starts our counter at zero. The second argument `i < 3` is the condition that is being checked. Finally, the argument `i++` tells the loop to increment by one each time the loop runs.
    
*   We can even loop forever using the following code:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            while (true)
            {
                printf("meow\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that `true` will always be the case. Therefore, the code will always run. You will lose control of your terminal window by running this code. You can break from an infinite by hitting `control-C` on your keyboard.
    

Linux and the Command Line
--------------------------

*   _Linux_ is an operating system that is accessible via the command line in the terminal window in VS Code.
*   Some common command-line arguments we may use include:
    *   `cd`, for changing our current directory (folder)
    *   `cp`, for copying files and directories
    *   `ls`, for listing files in a directory
    *   `mkdir`, for making a directory
    *   `mv`, for moving (renaming) files and directories
    *   `rm`, for removing (deleting) files
    *   `rmdir`, for removing (deleting) directories
*   The most commonly used is `ls` which will list all the files in the current directory or directory. Go ahead and type `ls` into the terminal window and hit `enter`. Youâ€™ll see all the files in the current folder.
*   Another useful command is `mv`, where you can move a file from one file to another. For example, you could use this command to rename `Hello.c` (notice the uppercase `H`) to `hello.c` by typing `mv Hello.c hello.c`.
*   You can also create folders. You can type `mkdir pset1` to create a directory called `pset1`.
*   You can then use `cd pset1` to change your current directory to `pset1`.
