-------------

*   We can take command-line arguments with:
    
        from sys import argv
        
        for i in range(len(argv)):
            print(argv[i])
        
    
    *   Since `argv` is a list of strings, we can use `len()` to get its length, and `range()` for a range of values that we can use as an index for each element in the list.
*   But we can also let Python iterate over the list for us:
    
        from sys import argv
        
        for arg in argv:
            print(arg)
        
    
*   We can return exit codes when our program exits, too:
    
        from sys import argv, exit
        
        if len(argv) != 2:
            print("missing command-line argument")
            exit(1)
        print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
        exit(0)
        
    
    *   We import the `exit` function, and call it with the code we want our program to exit with.
*   We can implement linear search by just checking each element in a list:
    
        import sys
        
        names = ["EMMA", "RODRIGO", "BRIAN", "DAVID"]
        
        if "EMMA" in names:
            print("Found")
            sys.exit(0)
        print("Not found")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    
*   If we have a dictionary, a set of key:value pairs, we can also check each key:
    
        import sys
        
        people = {
            "EMMA": "617-555-0100",
            "RODRIGO": "617-555-0101",
            "BRIAN": "617-555-0102",
            "DAVID": "617-555-0103"
        }
        
        if "EMMA" in people:
            print(f"Found {people['EMMA']}")
            sys.exit(0)
        print("Not found")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    
    *   Notice that we can get the value of of a particular key in a dictionary with `people['EMMA']`. Here, we use single quotes (both single and double quotes are allowed, as long they match for a string) to differentiate the inner string from the outer string.
    *   And we declare dictionaries with curly braces, `{}`, and lists with brackets `[]`.
*   In Python, we can compare strings directly with just `==`:
    
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        s = get_string("s: ")
        t = get_string("t: ")
        
        if s == t:
            print("Same")
        else:
            print("Different")
        
    
*   Copying strings, too, works without any extra work from us:
    
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        s = get_string("s: ")
        
        t = s
        
        t = t.capitalize()
        
        print(f"s: {s}")
        print(f"t: {t}")
        
    
*   Swapping two variables can also be done by assigning both values at the same time:
    
        x = 1
        y = 2
        
        print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
        x, y = y, x
        print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
