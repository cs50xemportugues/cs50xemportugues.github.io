Variables
---------

*   Variable declaration is simplified too. In C, you might have `int counter = 1;`. In Python, this same line would read `counter = 1`. You need not declare the type of the variable.
*   Python favors `counter += 1` to increment by one, losing the ability found in C to type `counter++`.

Loops
-----

*   Loops in Python are very similar to C. You may recall the following code in C:
    
        // Demonstrates while loop
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = 0;
            while (i < 3)
            {
                printf("meow\n");
                i++;
            }
        }
        
    
*   In Python, this code appears as:
    
        # Demonstrates while loop
        
        i = 0
        while i < 3:
            print("meow")
            i += 1
        
    
*   `for` loops can be implemented in Python as follows:
    
        # Better design
        
        for i in range(3):
            print("meow")
        
    
*   Similarly, one could express the above code as:
    
        # Abstraction with parameterization
        
        def main():
            meow(3)
        
        
        # Meow some number of times
        def meow(n):
            for i in range(n):
                print("meow")
        
        
        main()
        
    
    Notice that a function is utilized to abstract away the meowing.
