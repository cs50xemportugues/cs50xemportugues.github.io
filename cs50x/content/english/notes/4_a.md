Welcome!
--------

*   In previous weeks, we talked about images being made of smaller building blocks called pixels.
*   Today, we will go into further detail about the zeros and ones that make up these images.
*   Further, we will discuss how to access the underlying data stored in computer memory.

Memory
------

*   You can imagine a crime drama where an image is enhanced, enhanced, and enhanced, is not entirely real-life accurate. Indeed, if you keep zooming into an image, you will see pixels.

*   You can imagine as an image as a map of bits, where zeros represent black and ones represent white.
    
    ![Zeros and ones being converted to a black and white smiley](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide015.png "smiley")
    
*   _RGB_, or _red, green, blue_, are numbers that represent the amount of each of these colors. In Adobe Photoshop, you can see these settings as follows:
    
    ![A photoshop panel with RGB values and hexidecimal input](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide016.png "hex in photoshop")
    
    Notice how the amount of red, blue, and green changes the color selected.
    
*   You can see by the image above that color is not just represented in three values. At the bottom of the window, there is a special value made up of numbers and characters. `255` is represented as `FF`. Why might this be?
    

Hexadecimal
-----------

*   _Hexadecimal_ is a system of counting that has 16 counting values. They are as follows:
    
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f
        
    
    Notice that `F` represents `15`.
    
*   Hexadecimal is also known as _base-16_.
*   When counting in hexadecimal, each column is a power of 16.
*   The number `0` is represented as `00`.
*   The number `1` is represented as `01`.
*   The number `9` is represented by `09`.
*   The number `10` is represented as `0A`.
*   The number `15` is represented as `0F`.
*   The number `16` is represented as `10`.
*   The number `255` is represented as `FF`, because 16 x 15 (or `F`) is 240. Add 15 more to make 255. This is the highest number you can count using a two-digit hexadecimal system.
*   Hexadecimal is useful because it can be represented using fewer digits. Hexadecimal allows us to represent information more succinctly.
