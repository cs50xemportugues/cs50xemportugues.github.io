String
------

*   But after we run our program, we see `hello, world$`, with the new prompt on the same line as our output. It turns out that we need to specify precisely that we need a new line after our program, so we can update our code to include a special newline character, `\n`:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
    *   Now we need to remember to recompile our program with `clang hello.c` before we can run this new version.
*   Line 2 of our program is intentionally blank since we want to start a new section of code, much like starting new paragraphs in essays. It’s not strictly necessary for our program to run correctly, but it helps humans read longer programs more easily.
*   We can change the name of our program from `a.out` to something else, too. We can pass **command-line arguments**, or additional options, to programs in the terminal, depending on what the program is written to understand. For example, we can type `clang -o hello hello.c`, and `-o hello` is telling the program `clang` to save the compiled output as just `hello`. Then, we can just run `./hello`.
*   In our command prompt, we can run other commands, like `ls` (list), which shows the files in our current folder:
    
        $ ls
        a.out* hello* hello.c
        
    
    *   The asterisk, `*`, indicates that those files are executable, or that they can be run by our computer.
*   We can use the `rm` (remove) command to delete a file:
    
        $ rm a.out
        rm: remove regular file 'a.out'?
        
    
    *   We can type `y` or `yes` to confirm, and use `ls` again to see that it’s indeed gone forever.
*   Now, let’s try to get input from the user, as we did in Scratch when we wanted to say “hello, David”:  
    ![screenshot of blocks "ask what's your name? and wait", "say join hello, answer"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/ask_say_join.png)
    
        string answer = get_string("What's your name?\n");
        printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
        
    
    *   First, we need a **string**, or piece of text (specifically, zero or more characters in a sequence in double quotes, like `""`, `"ba"`, or “bananas”), that we can ask the user for, with the function `get_string`. We pass the prompt, or what we want to ask the user, to the function with `"What is your name?\n"` inside the parentheses. On the left, we want to create a variable, `answer`, the value of which will be what the user enters. (The equals sign `=` is setting the value from right to left.) Finally, the type of variable that we want is `string`, so we specify that to the left of `answer`.
    *   Next, inside the `printf` function, we want the value of `answer` in what we print back out. We use a placeholder for our string variable, `%s`, inside the phrase we want to print, like `"hello, %s\n"`, and then we give `printf` another argument, or option, to tell it that we want the variable `answer` to be substituted.
*   If we made a mistake, like writing `printf("hello, world"\n);` with the `\n` outside of the double quotes for our string, we’ll see an errors from our compiler:
    
        $ clang -o hello hello.c
        hello.c:5:26: error: expected ')'
            printf("hello, world"\n);
                                 ^
        hello.c:5:11: note: to match this '('
            printf("hello, world"\n);
                  ^
        1 error generated.
        
    
    *   The first line of the error tells us to look at `hello.c`, line 5, column 26, where the compiler expected a closing parentheses, instead of a backslash.
*   To simplify things (at least for the beginning), we’ll include a library, or set of code, from CS50. The library provides us with the `string` variable type, the `get_string` function, and more. We just have to write a line at the top to `include` the file `cs50.h`:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
            printf("hello, name\n");
        }
        
    
*   So let’s make a new file, `string.c`, with this code:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }
        
    
*   Now, if we try to compile that code, we get a lot of lines of errors. Sometimes, one mistake means that the compiler then starts interpreting correct code incorrectly, generating more errors than there actually are. So we start with our first error:
    
        $ clang -o string string.c
        string.c:5:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'string'; did you mean 'stdin'?
          string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
          ^~~~~~
          stdin
        /usr/include/stdio.h:135:25: note: 'stdin' declared here
        extern struct _IO_FILE *stdin;          /* Standard input stream.  */
        
    
    *   We didn’t mean `stdin` (“standard in”) instead of `string`, so that error message wasn’t helpful. In fact, we need to import another file that defines the type `string` (actually a training wheel from CS50, as we’ll find out in the coming weeks).
*   So we can include another file, `cs50.h`, which also includes the function `get_string`, among others.
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }
        
    
*   Now, when we try to compile our program, we have just one error:
    
        $ clang -o string string.c
        /tmp/string-aca94d.o: In function `main':
        string.c:(.text+0x19): undefined reference to `get_string'
        clang-7: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
        
    
    *   It turns out that we also have to tell our compiler to add our special CS50 library file, with `clang -o string string.c -lcs50`, with `-l` for “link”.
*   We can even abstract this away and just type `make string`. We see that, by default in the CS50 Sandbox, `make` uses `clang` to compile our code from `string.c` into `string`, with all the necessary arguments, or flags, passed in.
