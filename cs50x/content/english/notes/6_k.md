Phonebook
---------

*   Recall that a _dictionary_ or `dict` is a collection of _key_ and _value_ pairs.
*   You can implement a dictionary in Python as follows:
    
        # Implements a phone book
        
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        people = {
            "Carter": "+1-617-495-1000",
            "David": "+1-949-468-2750"
        }
        
        # Search for name
        name = get_string("Name: ")
        if name in people:
            print(f"Number: {people[name]}")
        
    
    Notice that the dictionary is implemented using curly braces. Then, the statement `if name in people` searches to see if the `name` is in the `people` dictionary. Further, notice how, in the `print` statement, we can index into the people dictionary using the value of `name`. Very useful!
    
*   Python has done their best to get to _constant time_ using their built-in searches.

Comparison
----------

*   We can implement comparisons as follows in Python:
    
        # Compares two strings
        
        # Get two strings
        s = input("s: ")
        t = input("t: ")
        
        # Compare strings
        if s == t:
            print("Same")
        else:
            print("Different")
        
    
    Notice how Python utilizes the `==` to be able to compare two variables. Further, notice that Python allows you to compare two strings without examining strings character by character using pointers as in C.
    

Swap
----

*   Further, we can implement a program that swaps values as we did in C. Consider the following code in Python:
    
        # Swaps two integers
        
        x = 1
        y = 2
        
        print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
        x, y = y, x
        print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
        
    
    Notice that each value is swapped, using some very _Pythonic_ syntax `x, y = y, x`.
