## Scratch

- _Scratch_ is a visual programming language developed by MIT.
- Scratch utilizes the same essential coding building blocks that we covered earlier in this lecture.
- Scatch is a great way to get into computer programming because it allows you to play with these building blocks in a visual manner, not having to be concerned about the syntax of curly braces, semicolons, parentheses, and the like.
- Scatch `IDE` (integrated development environment) looks like the following:

  ![scratch interface](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide162.png "scratch interface") Notice that on the left, there are _building blocks_ that you can use in your programming. To the immediate right of the building blocks, there is the area to which you can drag blocks to build a program. To the right of that, you see the _stage_ where a cat stands. The stage is where your programming comes to life.

- Scratch operates on a coordinate system as follows:

  ![scratch coordinate system](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide167.png "scratch coordinate system") Notice that the center of the stage is at coordinate (0,0). Right now, the cat’s position is at that same position.

- To begin, drag the “when green flag clicked” building block to the programming area. Then, drag the `say` building block to the programming area and attach it to the previous block.

        when green flag clicked
        say [hello, world]

  Notice that when you click the green flag now, on the stage, the cat says, “hello world.”

- This illustrates quite well what we were discussing earlier regarding programming:

  ![scratch with black box](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide172.png "scratch with black box") Notice that the input `hello world` is passed to the function `say`, and the _side effect_ of that function running is the cat saying `hello world`.

- We can make your program more interactive by having the cat say `hello` to someone specific. Modify your program as below:

        when green flag clicked
        ask [What's your name?] and wait
        say (join [hello,] (answer))

  Notice that when the green flag is clicked, the function `ask` is run. The program prompts you, the user, `What's your name?` It then stores that name in the _variable_ called `answer`. The program then passes `answer` to a special function called `join`, which combines two strings of text `hello`, and whatever name was provided. These collectively are passed to the `say` function. The cat says, `Hello,` and a name. Your program is now interactive.

- Quite similarly, we can modify our program as follows:

        when green flag clicked
        ask [What's your name?] and wait
        speak (join [hello,] (answer))

  Notice that this program, when the green flag is clicked, passes the same variable, joined with `hello`, to a function called `speak`.
