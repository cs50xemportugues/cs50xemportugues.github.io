Files
-----

*   You can read from and manipulate files. While this topic will be discussed further in a future week, consider the following code for `phonebook.c`:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Open CSV file
            FILE *file = fopen("phonebook.csv", "a");
        
            // Get name and number
            char *name = get_string("Name: ");
            char *number = get_string("Number: ");
        
            // Print to file
            fprintf(file, "%s,%s\n", name, number);
        
            // Close file
            fclose(file);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code uses pointers to access the file.
    
*   You can create a file called `phonebook.csv` in advance of running the above code. After running the above program and inputting a name and phone number, you will notice that this data persists in your CSV file.
    

Summing Up
----------

In this lesson, you learned about pointers that provide you with the ability to access and manipulate data at specific memory locations. Specifically, we delved intoâ€¦

*   Memory
*   Hexadecimal
*   Addresses
*   Pointers
*   Strings
*   Pointer Arithmetic
*   Comparing strings
*   Copying
*   Valgrind
*   Garbage values
*   Swap
*   Overflow
*   `scanf`

See you next time!
