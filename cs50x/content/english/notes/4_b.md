string
------

*   We might have a variable `string s` for a name like `EMMA`, and be able to access each character with `s[0]` and so on:  
    ![boxes side by side, containing: E labeled s[0], M labeled s[1], M labeled s[2], A labeled s[3], \0 labeled s[4]](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/s_array.png)
*   But it turns out that each character is stored in memory at a byte with some address, and `s` is actually just a pointer with the address of the first character:  
    ![box containing 0x123 labeled s, boxes side by side containing E labeled 0x123, M labeled 0x124, M labeled 0x125, A labeled 0x126, \0 labeled 0x127](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/s_pointer.png)
*   And since `s` is just a pointer to the beginning, only the `\0` indicates the end of the string.
*   In fact, the CS50 Library defines a `string` with `typedef char *string`, which just says that we want to name a new type, `string`, as a `char *`, or a pointer to a character.
*   Let’s print out a string:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = "EMMA";
            printf("%s\n", s);
        }
        
    
*   This is familiar, but we can just say:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s = "EMMA";
            printf("%s\n", s);
        }
        
    
    *   This will also print `EMMA`.
*   With `printf("%p\n", s);`, we can print `s` as its value as a pointer, like `0x42ab52`. (`printf` knows to go to the address and print the entire string when we use `%s` and pass in `s`, even though `s` only points to the first character.)
*   We can also try `printf("%p\n", &s[0]);`, which is the address of the first character of `s`, and it’s exactly the same as printing `s`. And printing `&s[1]`, `&s[2]`, and `&s[3]` gets us the addresses that are the next characters in memory after `&s[0]`, like `0x42ab53`, `0x42ab54`, and `0x42ab55`, exactly one byte after another.
*   And finally, if we try to `printf("%c\n", *s);`, we get a single character `E`, since we’re going to the address contained in `s`, which has the first character in the string.
*   In fact, `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` actually map directly to `*s`, `*(s+1)`, and `*(s+2)`, since each of the next characters are just at the address of the next byte.

Compare and copy
----------------

*   Let’s look at `compare0`:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get two integers
            int i = get_int("i: ");
            int j = get_int("j: ");
        
            // Compare integers
            if (i == j)
            {
                printf("Same\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("Different\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   We can compile and run this, and our program works as we’d expect, with the same values of the two integers giving us “Same” and different values “Different”.
*   In `compare1`, we see that the same string values are causing our program to print “Different”:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Get two strings
            string s = get_string("s: ");
            string t = get_string("t: ");
        
            // Compare strings' addresses
            if (s == t)
            {
                printf("Same\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("Different\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    *   Given what we now know about strings, this makes sense because each “string” variable is pointing to a different location in memory, where the first character of each string is stored. So even if the values of the strings are the same, this will always print “Different”.
    *   For example, our first string might be at address 0x123, our second might be at 0x456, and `s` will be `0x123` and `t` will be `0x456`, so those values will be different.
    *   And `get_string`, this whole time, has been returning just a `char *`, or a pointer to the first character of a string from the user.
*   Now let’s try to copy a string:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <ctype.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string s = get_string("s: ");
        
            string t = s;
        
            t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
        
            // Print string twice
            printf("s: %s\n", s);
            printf("t: %s\n", t);
        }
        
    
    *   We get a string `s`, and copy the value of `s` into `t`. Then, we capitalize the first letter in `t`.
    *   But when we run our program, we see that both `s` and `t` are now capitalized.
    *   Since we set `s` and `t` to the same values, they’re actually pointers to the same character, and so we capitalized the same character!
*   To actually make a copy of a string, we have to do a little more work:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <ctype.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            char *s = get_string("s: ");
        
            char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);
        
            for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n + 1; i++)
            {
                t[i] = s[i];
            }
        
            t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
        
            printf("s: %s\n", s);
            printf("t: %s\n", t);
        }
        
    
    *   We create a new variable, `t`, of the type `char *`, with `char *t`. Now, we want to point it to a new chunk of memory that’s large enough to store the copy of the string. With `malloc`, we can allocate some number of bytes in memory (that aren’t already used to store other values), and we pass in the number of bytes we’d like. We already know the length of `s`, so we add 1 to that for the terminating null character. So, our final line of code is `char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);`.
    *   Then, we copy each character, one at a time, and now we can capitalize just the first letter of `t`. And we use `i < n + 1`, since we actually want to go up to `n`, to ensure we copy the terminating character in the string.
    *   We can actually also use the `strcpy` library function with `strcpy(t, s)` instead of our loop, to copy the string `s` into `t`. To be clear, the concept of a “string” is from the C language and well-supported; the only training wheels from CS50 are the type `string` instead of `char *`, and the `get_string` function.
*   If we didn’t copy the null terminating character, `\0`, and tried to print out our string `t`, `printf` will continue and print out the unknown, or garbage, values that we have in memory, until it happens to reach a `\0`, or crashes entirely, since our program might end up trying to read memory that doesn’t belong to it!
