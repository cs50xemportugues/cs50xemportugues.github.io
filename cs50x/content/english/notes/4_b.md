Addresses
---------

*   In weeks past, you may recall our artist rendering of concurrent blocks of memory. Applying hexadecimal numbering to each of these blocks of memory, you can visualize these as follows:
    
    ![Blocks of memory numbered in hex](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide065.png "memory hex")
    
*   You can imagine how there may be confusion regarding whether the `10` block above may represent a location in memory or the value `10`. Accordingly, by convention, all hexadecimal numbers are often represented with the `0x` prefix as follows:
    
    ![blocks of memory numbered in hex with 0x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide066.png "0x")
    
*   In your terminal window, type `code addresses.c` and write your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = 50;
            printf("%i\n", n);
        }
        
    
    Notice how `n` is stored in memory with the value `50`.
    
*   You can visualize how this program stores this value as follows:
    
    ![the value 50 stored in a memory location with hex](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide070.png "hex")
    
*   The `C` language has two powerful operators that relate to memory:
    
          & Provides the address of something stored in memory.
          * Instructs the compiler to go to a location in memory.
        
    
*   We can leverage this knowledge by modifying our code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = 50;
            printf("%p\n", &n);
        }
        
    
    Notice the `%p`, which allows us to view the address of a location in memory. `&n` can be literally translated as “the address of `n`.” Executing this code will return an address of memory beginning with `0x`.
    

Pointers
--------

*   A _pointer_ is a variable that contains the address of some value. Most succinctly, a pointer is an address in your computer’s memory.
*   Consider the following code:
    
        int n = 50;
        
        int *p = &n;
        
    
    Notice that `p` is a pointer that contains a number that is the address of an integer `n`.
    
*   Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = 50;
            int *p = &n;
            printf("%p\n", p);
        }
        
    
    Notice that this code has the same effect as our previous code. We have simply leveraged our new knowledge of the `&` and `*` operators.
    
*   You can visualize our code as follows:
    
    ![Same value of 50 in a memory location with a pointer value stored elsewhere](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide078.png "pointer")
    
    Notice the pointer seems rather large. Indeed, a pointer is usually stored as an 8-byte value.
    
*   You can more accurately visualize a pointer as one address that points to another:
    
    ![A pointer as an arrow, pointing from one location of memory to another](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide079.png "pointer")
    
*   To illustrate the use of the `*` operator, consider the following:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = 50;
            int *p = &n;
            printf("%i\n", *p);
        }
        
    
    Notice that the `printf` line prints the integer at the location of `p`.
