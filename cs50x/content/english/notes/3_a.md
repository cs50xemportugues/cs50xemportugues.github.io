Welcome!
--------

*   In week zero, we introduced the idea of an _algorithm_.
*   This week, we are going to expand upon our understanding of algorithms through pseudocode and into code itself.
*   Also, we are going to consider the efficiency of these algorithms. Indeed, we are going to be building upon our understanding of how to use some of the _lower-level_ concepts we discussed last week in building algorithms.

Algorithms
----------

*   Recall that last week you were introduced to the idea of an _array_, blocks of memory that are side-by-side with one another.
*   You can metaphorically imagine an array like a series of seven red lockers as follows:
    
    ![Seven red lockers side by side](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/3/cs50Week3Slide018.png "lockers")
    
*   We can imagine that we have an essential problem of wanting to know, “Is the number 50 inside an array?”
*   We can potentially hand our array to an algorithm, wherein our algorithm will search through our lockers to see if the number 50 is behind one of the doors: Returning the value true or false.
    
    ![seven red lockers pointing to an empty box. Out of the empty box comes and output of bool](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/3/cs50Week3Slide022.png "lockers as algorithm")
    
*   We can imagine various instructions we might provide our algorithm to undertake this task as follows:
    
        For each door from left to right
            If 50 is behind door
                Return true
        Return false
        
    
    Notice that the above instructions are called _pseudocode_: A human-readable version of the instructions that we could provide the computer.
    
*   A computer scientist could translate that pseudocode as follows:
    
        For i from 0 to n-1
            If 50 is behind doors[i]
                Return true
        Return false
        
    
    Notice that the above is still not code, but it is a pretty close approximation of what the final code might look like.
    
*   _Binary search_ is a _search algorithm_ that could be employed in our task of finding the 50.
*   Assuming that the values within the lockers have been arranged from smallest to largest, the pseudocode for binary search would appear as follows:
    
        If there are no doors
            Return false
        If 50 is behind middle door
            Return true
        Else if 50 < middle door
            Search left half
        Else if 50 > middle door
            Search right half
        
    
*   Using the nomenclature of code, we can further modify our algorithm as follows:
    
        If no doors
            Return false
        If 50 is behind doors[middle]
            Return true
        Else if 50 < doors[middle]
            Search doors[0] through doors[middle-1]
        Else if 50 > doors[middle]
            Search doors[middle+1] through doors[n-1]
        
    
    Notice, looking at this approximation of code, you can nearly imagine what this might look like in actual code.
