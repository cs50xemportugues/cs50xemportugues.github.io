 
*   To implement this in code, modify your code as follows:
    
        // Prepends numbers to a linked list, using while loop to print
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        typedef struct node
        {
            int number;
            struct node *next;
        }
        node;
        
        int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            // Memory for numbers
            node *list = NULL;
        
            // For each command-line argument
            for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++)
            {
                // Convert argument to int
                int number = atoi(argv[i]);
        
                // Allocate node for number
                node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
                if (n == NULL)
                {
                    return 1;
                }
                n->number = number;
                n->next = NULL;
        
                // Prepend node to list
                n->next = list;
                list = n;
            }
        
            // Print numbers
            node *ptr = list;
            while (ptr != NULL)
            {
                printf("%i\n", ptr->number);
                ptr = ptr->next;
            }
        
            // Free memory
            ptr = list;
            while (ptr != NULL)
            {
                node *next = ptr->next;
                free(ptr);
                ptr = next;
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that what the user inputs at the command line is put into the `number` field of a node called `n`, and then that node is added to the `list`. For example, `./list 1 2` will put the number `1` into the `number` field of a node called `n`, then put a pointer to `list` into the `next` field of the node, and then update `list` to point to `n`. That same process is repeated for `2`. Next, `node *ptr = list` creates a temporary variable that points at the same spot that `list` points to. The `while` prints what at the node `ptr` points to, and then updates `ptr` to point to the `next` node in the list. Finally, all the memory is freed.
    
*   Considering the amount of time required to search this list, it is in the order of \\(O(n)\\), as in the worst case the entire list must always be searched to find an item. The time complexity for adding a new element to the list will depend on where that element is added. This is illustrated in the examples below.
*   You, as the programmer, have the choice of how to implement your list. The following code, for example, implements a linked list that prepends numbers to the front of the list:
    
        // Prepends numbers to a linked list, using for loop to print
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        typedef struct node
        {
            int number;
            struct node *next;
        }
        node;
        
        int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            // Memory for numbers
            node *list = NULL;
        
            // For each command-line argument
            for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++)
            {
                // Convert argument to int
                int number = atoi(argv[i]);
        
                // Allocate node for number
                node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
                if (n == NULL)
                {
                    return 1;
                }
                n->number = number;
                n->next = NULL;
        
                // Prepend node to list
                n->next = list;
                list = n;
            }
        
            // Print numbers
            for (node *ptr = list; ptr != NULL; ptr = ptr->next)
            {
                printf("%i\n", ptr->number);
            }
        
            // Free memory
            node *ptr = list;
            while (ptr != NULL)
            {
                node *next = ptr->next;
                free(ptr);
                ptr = next;
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice how numbers are placed at the start of the list. This insertion will run in the order of \\(O(1)\\), as the number of steps it takes to do this does not depend on the size of the list.
