Emojis
------

*   As time has rolled on, there are more and more ways to communicate via text.
*   Since there were not enough digits in binary to represent all the various characters that could be represented by humans, the _Unicode_ standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computers.
*   There are emojis that you probably use every day. The following may look familiar to you:

*   Computer scientists faced a challenge when wanting to assign various skin tones to each emoji to allow the communication to be further personalized. In this case, the creators and contributors of emojis decided that the initial bits would be the structure of the emoji itself, followed by skin tone.
*   More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters and emojis.

RGB
---

*   Red, green, and blue (called `RGB`) is a combination of three numbers.

*   Taking our previously used 72, 73, and 33, which said `HI!` via text, would be interpreted by image readers as a light shade of yellow. The red value would be 72, the green value would be 73, and the blue would be 33.

Images, Video and Sound
-----------------------

*   Images are simply collections of RGB values.
*   Videos are sequences of many images that are stored together, just like a flipbook.
*   Music can be represented through MIDI data.

Algorithms
----------

*   Problem-solving is central to computer science and computer programming.
*   Imagine the basic problem of trying to locate a single name in a phone book.
*   How might you go about this?
*   One approach could be to simply read from page one to the next to the next until reaching the last page.
*   Another approach could be to search two pages at a time.
*   A final and perhaps better approach could be to go to the middle of the phone book and ask, “Is the name I am looking for to the left or to the right?” Then, repeat this process, cutting the problem in half and half and half.
*   Each of these approaches could be called algorithms. The speed of each of these algorithms can be pictured as follows in what is called _big-O notation_:
    
    ![big o notation](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/cs50Week0Slide141.png "big o notation") Notice that the first algorithm, highlighted in red, has a big-O of `n` because if there are 100 names in the phone book, it could take up to 100 tries to find the correct name. The second algorithm, where two pages were searched at a time, has a big-O of ‘n/2’ because we searched twice as fast through the pages. The final algorithm has a big-O of log2n as doubling the problem would only result in one more step to solve the problem.
    

Pseudocode and the Basic Building Blocks of Programming
-------------------------------------------------------

*   The ability to create _pseudocode_ is central to one’s success in both this class and in computer programming.
*   Pseudocode is a human-readable version of your code. For example, considering the third algorithm above, we could compose pseudocode as follows:
    
          1  Pick up phone book
          2  Open to middle of phone book
          3  Look at page
          4  If person is on page
          5      Call person
          6  Else if person is earlier in book
          7      Open to middle of left half of book
          8      Go back to line 3
          9  Else if person is later in book
          10     Open to middle of right half of book
          11     Go back to line 3
          12 Else
          13     Quit
        
    
*   Pseudocoding is such an important skill for at least two reasons. First, when you pseudocode before you create formal code, it allows you to think through the logic of your problem in advance. Second, when you pseudocode, you can later provide this information to others that are seeking to understand your coding decisions and how your code works.
*   Notice that the language within our pseudocode has some unique features. First, some of these lines begin with verbs like _pick up,_ _open,_ _look at._ Later, we will call these _functions_.
*   Second, notice that some lines include statements like `if` or `else if.` These are called _conditionals_.
*   Third, notice how there are expressions that can be stated as _true_ or _false,_ such as “person is earlier in the book.” We call these _boolean expressions_.
*   Finally, notice how these statements like “go back to line 3.” We call these _loops_.
*   In the context of _Scratch_, which is discussed below, we will use each of the above basic building blocks of programming.
