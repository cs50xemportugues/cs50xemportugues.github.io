Indexes
-------

*   While relational databases have the ability to be more fast and more robust than utilizing a `CSV` file, data can be optimized within a table using _indexes_.
*   Indexes can be utilized to speed up our queries.
*   We can track the speed of our queries by executing `.timer on` in `sqlite3`.
*   To understand how indexes can speed up our queries, run the following: `SELECT * FROM shows WHERE title = 'The Office';` Notice the time that displays after the query executes.
*   Then, we can create an index with the syntax `CREATE INDEX title_index on shows (title);`. This tells `sqlite3` to create an index and perform some special under-the-hood optimization relating to this column `title`.
*   This will create a data structure called a _B Tree_, a data structure that looks similar to a binary tree. However, unlike a binary tree, there can be more than two child notes.
    
    ![one node at the top from which come four children and below that there are three children coming from one of the nodes and two from another two from another and three from another](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/7/cs50Week7Slide039.png "b tree")
    
*   Running the query `SELECT * FROM shows WHERE title = 'The Office';`, you will notice that the query runs much more quickly!
*   Unfortunately, indexing all columns would result in utilizing more storage space. Therefore, there is a tradeoff for enhanced speed.

Using SQL in Python
-------------------

*   To assist in working with SQL in this course, the CS50 Library can be utilized as follows in your code:
    
        from cs50 import SQL
        
    
*   Similar to previous uses of the CS50 Library, this library will assist with the complicated steps of utilizing SQL within your Python code.
*   You can read more about the CS50 Libraryâ€™s SQL functionality in the [documentation](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/python/#cs50.SQL).
*   Recall where we last left off in `favorites.py`. Your code should appear as follows:
    
        # Favorite problem instead of favorite language
        
        import csv
        
        # Open CSV file
        with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
        
            # Create DictReader
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
            # Counts
            counts = {}
        
            # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
            for row in reader:
                favorite = row["problem"]
                if favorite in counts:
                    counts[favorite] += 1
                else:
                    counts[favorite] = 1
        
        # Print count
        favorite = input("Favorite: ")
        if favorite in counts:
            print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
