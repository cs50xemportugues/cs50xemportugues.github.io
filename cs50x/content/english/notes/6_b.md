Types
-----

*   Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how `answer` above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.
*   In Python, commonly used types include:
    
          bool
          float
          int
          str
        
    
    Notice that `long` and `double` are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.
    
*   Some other data types in Python include:
    
          range
          list
          tuple
          dict
          set
        
    
*   Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python they can be implemented more simply.

*   To illustrate this simplicity, let’s type ‘code dictionary.py’ in the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
        # Words in dictionary
        words = set()
        
        
        def check(word):
            """Return true if word is in dictionary else false"""
            if word.lower() in words:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        
        
        def load(dictionary):
            """Load dictionary into memory, returning true if successful else false"""
            file = open(dictionary, "r")
            for line in file:
                word = line.rstrip()
                words.add(word)
            file.close()
            return True
        
        
        def size():
            """Returns number of words in dictionary if loaded else 0 if not yet loaded"""
            return len(words)
        
        
        def unload():
            """Unloads dictionary from memory, returning true if successful else false"""
            return True
        
    
    Notice that there are four functions above. In the `check` function, if a `word` is in `words`, it returns `True`. So much easier than an implementation in C! Similarly, in the `load` function the dictionary file is opened. For each line in that file, we add that line to `words`. Using `rstrip`, the trailing new line is removed from the added word. `size` simply returns the `len` or length of `words`. `unload` only needs to return `True` because Python handles memory management on its own.
    
*   The above code illustrates why higher-level languages exist: To simplify and allow you to write code more easily.
*   However, speed is a tradeoff. Because C allows you, the programmer, to make decisions about memory management, it may run faster than Python – depending on your code. While C only runs your lines of code, Python runs all the code that comes under the hood with it when you call Python’s built-in functions.
