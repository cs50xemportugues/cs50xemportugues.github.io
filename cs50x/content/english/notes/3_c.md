Data Structures
---------------

*   It turns out that C allows a way by which we can create our own data types via a `struct`. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        
        typedef struct
        {
            string name;
            string number;
        }
        person;
        
        int main(void)
        {
            person people[2];
        
            people[0].name = "Carter";
            people[0].number = "+1-617-495-1000";
        
            people[1].name = "David";
            people[1].number = "+1-949-468-2750";
        
            // Search for name
            string name = get_string("Name: ");
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
            {
                if (strcmp(people[i].name, name) == 0)
                {
                    printf("Found %s\n", people[i].number);
                    return 0;
                }
            }
            printf("Not found\n");
            return 1;
        }
        
    
    Notice that the code begins with `typedef struct` where a new datatype called `person` is defined. Inside a `person` is a string called `name` and a `string` called number. In the `main` function, begin by creating an array called `people` that is of type `person` that is a size of 2. Then, we update the names and phone numbers of the two people in our `people` array. Most important, notice how the _dot notation_ such as `people[0].name` allows us to access the `person` at the 0th location and assign that individual a name.
    

Sorting
-------

*   _sorting_ is the act of taking an unsorted list of values and transforming this list into a sorted one.
*   When a list is sorted, searching that list is far less taxing on the computer. Recall that we can use binary search on a sorted list, but not on an unsorted one.
*   It turns out that there are many different types of sort algorithms.
*   _Selection sort_ is one such search algorithm.
*   The algorithm for selection sort in pseudocode is:
    
        For i from 0 to n–1
            Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
            Swap smallest number with numbers[i]
        
    
*   Consider the unsorted list as follows:
    
          5 2 7 4 1 6 3 0
          ^
        
    
*   Selection sort will begin by looking for the smallest number in the list and swap that number with our current position in the list. In this case, the zero is located and moved to our current position.
    
          0 | 2 7 4 1 6 3 5
        
    
*   Now, our problem has gotten smaller since we know at least the beginning of our list is sorted. So we can repeat what we did, starting from the second number in the list:
    
          0 | 2 7 4 1 6 3 5
              ^    
        
    
*   1 is the smallest number now, so we’ll swap it with the second number. We’ll repeat this again …
    
          0 1 | 7 4 2 6 3 5
                ^     
        
    
*   … and again…
    
          0 1 2 | 4 7 6 3 5
                  ^
        
    
*   … and again…
    
          0 1 2 3 | 7 6 4 5
                    ^
        
    
*   … and again …
    
          0 1 2 3 4 | 6 7 5
                      ^
        
    
*   and so on.
*   _Bubble sort_ is another sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping elements to “bubble” larger elements to the end.
*   The pseudocode for bubble sort is:
    
        Repeat n-1 times
        For i from 0 to n–2
            If numbers[i] and numbers[i+1] out of order
                Swap them
        
    
*   We’ll start with our unsorted list, but this time we’ll look at pairs of numbers and swap them if they are out of order:
    
        5 2 7 4 1 6 3 0
        ^ ^
        2 5 7 4 1 6 3 0
          ^ ^
        2 5 7 4 1 6 3 0
            ^ ^
        2 5 4 7 1 6 3 0
              ^ ^
        2 5 4 1 7 6 3 0
                ^ ^
        2 5 4 1 6 7 3 0
                  ^ ^
        2 5 4 1 6 3 7 0
                    ^ ^
        2 5 4 1 6 3 0 7
        
    
*   Now, the highest number is all the way to the right, so we’ve improved our problem. We’ll repeat this again:
    
        2 5 4 1 6 3 0 | 7
        ^ ^
        2 5 4 1 6 3 0 | 7
          ^ ^
        2 4 5 1 6 3 0 | 7
            ^ ^
        2 4 1 5 6 3 0 | 7
              ^ ^
        2 4 1 5 6 3 0 | 7
                ^ ^
        2 4 1 5 3 6 0 | 7
                  ^ ^
        2 4 1 5 3 0 6 | 7
        
    
*   Now the two biggest values are on the right. We’ll repeat again:
    
          2 4 1 5 3 0 | 6 7
          ^ ^
          2 4 1 5 3 0 | 6 7
            ^ ^
          2 1 4 5 3 0 | 6 7
              ^ ^
          2 1 4 5 3 0 | 6 7
                ^ ^
          2 1 4 3 5 0 | 6 7
                  ^ ^
          2 1 4 3 0 5 | 6 7
        
    
*   … and again …
    
          2 1 4 3 0 | 5 6 7
          ^ ^
          1 2 4 3 0 | 5 6 7
            ^ ^
          1 2 3 4 0 | 5 6 7
              ^ ^
          1 2 3 4 0 | 5 6 7
                ^ ^
          1 2 3 0 4 | 5 6 7
        
    
*   … and again …
    
          1 2 3 0 | 4 5 6 7
          ^ ^
          1 2 3 0 | 4 5 6 7
            ^ ^
          1 2 3 0 | 4 5 6 7
              ^ ^
          1 2 0 3 | 4 5 6 7
        
    
*   … and again …
    
          1 2 0 | 3 4 5 6 7
          ^ ^
          1 2 0 | 3 4 5 6 7
            ^ ^
          1 0 2 | 3 4 5 6 7
        
    
*   … and finally …
    
          1 0 | 2 3 4 5 6 7
          ^ ^
          0 1 | 2 3 4 5 6 7
        
    
*   Notice that, as we go through our list, we know more and more of it becomes sorted, so we only need to look at the pairs of numbers that haven’t been sorted yet.
*   Analyzing selection sort, we made only seven comparisons. Representing this mathematically, where _n_ represents the number of cases, it could be said that selection sort can be analyzed as:
    
          (n-1)+(n-2)+(n-3)+ ... + 1
        
    
    or, more simply \\(n^2/2 - n/2\\).
    
*   Considering that mathematical analysis, n2 is really the most influential factor in determining the efficiency of this algorithm. Therefore, selection sort is considered to be of the order of \\(O(n^2)\\) in the worst case where all values are unsorted. Even when all values are sorted, it will take the same number of steps. Therefore, the best case can be noted as \\(\\Omega(n^2)\\). Since both the upper bound and lower bound cases are the same, the efficiency of this algorithm as a whole can be regarded as \\(\\Theta(n^2)\\).
*   Analyzing bubble sort, the worst case is \\(O(n^2)\\). The best case is \\(\\Omega(n)\\).
*   You can [visualize](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) a comparison of these algorithms.
