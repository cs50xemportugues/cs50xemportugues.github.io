Compare
-------

*   In C, we faced challenges when we wanted to compare two values. Consider the following code:
    
        // Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt user for integers
            int x = get_int("What's x? ");
            int y = get_int("What's y? ");
        
            // Compare integers
            if (x < y)
            {
                printf("x is less than y\n");
            }
            else if (x > y)
            {
                printf("x is greater than y\n");
            }
            else
            {
                printf("x is equal to y\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   In Python, we can execute the above as follows:
    
        # Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
        
        from cs50 import get_int
        
        # Prompt user for integers
        x = get_int("What's x? ")
        y = get_int("What's y? ")
        
        # Compare integers
        if x < y:
            print("x is less than y")
        elif x > y:
            print("x is greater than y")
        else:
            print("x is equal to y")
        
    
    Notice that the CS50 library is imported. Further, minor changes exist in the `if` statement.
    
*   Further looking at comparisons, consider the following code in C:
    
        // Logical operators
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // Prompt user to agree
            char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");
        
            // Check whether agreed
            if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')
            {
                printf("Agreed.\n");
            }
            else if (c == 'N' || c == 'n')
            {
                printf("Not agreed.\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   The above can be implemented as follows:
    
        # Logical operators
        
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        # Prompt user to agree
        s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
        
        # Check whether agreed
        if s == "Y" or s == "y":
            print("Agreed.")
        elif s == "N" or s == "n":
            print("Not agreed.")
        
    
    Notice that the two vertical bars utilized in C is replaced with `or`. Indeed, people often enjoy Python because it is more readable by humans. Also, notice that `char` does not exist in Python. Instead, `str`s are utilized.
    
*   Another approach to this same code could be as follows:
    
        # Logical operators, using lists
        
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        # Prompt user to agree
        s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
        
        # Check whether agreed
        if s in ["y", "yes"]:
            print("Agreed.")
        elif s in ["n", "no"]:
            print("Not agreed.")
        
    
    Notice how we are able to express multiple keywords like `y` and `yes`.
