Welcome!
--------

*   In our previous session, we learned about C, a text-based programming language.
*   This week, we are going to take a deeper look at additional building-blocks that will support our goals of learning more about programming from the bottom up.
*   Fundamentally, in addition to the essentials of programming, this course is about problem-solving. Accordingly, we will also focus further on how to approach computer science problems.

Compiling
---------

*   _Encryption_ is the act of hiding plain text from prying eyes. _decrypting_, then, is the act of taking an encrypted piece of text and returning it to a human-readable form.
*   An encrypted piece of text may look like the following:

*   Recall that last week you learned about a _compiler_, a specialized computer program that converts _source code_ into _machine code_ that can be understood by a computer.
*   For example, you might have a computer program that looks like this:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
*   A compiler will take the above code and turn it into the following machine code:
    
    ![machine code](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide012.png "machine code")
    
*   _VS Code_, the programming environment provided to you as a CS50 student, utilizes a compiler called `clang` or _c language_.
*   If you were to type `make hello`, it runs a command that executes clang to create an output file that you can run as a user.
*   VS Code has been pre-programmed such that `make` will run numerous command line arguments along with clang for your convenience as a user.
*   Consider the following code:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }
        
    
*   You can attempt to enter into the terminal window: `clang -o hello hello.c`. You will be met by an error that indicates that clang does not know where to find the `cs50.h` library.
*   Attempting again to compile this code, run the following command in the terminal window: `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50`. This will enable the compiler to access the `cs50.h` library.
*   Running in the terminal window `./hello`, your program will run as intended.
*   While the above is offered as an illustration, such that you can understand more deeply the process and concept of compiling code, using `make` in CS50 is perfectly fine and the expectation!
*   Compiling involves major steps, including the following:

*   First, _preprocessing_ is where the header files in your code, designated by a `#` (such as `#include \<cs50.h\>`) are effectively copied and pasted into your file. During this step, the code from `cs50.h` is copied into your program. Similarly, just as your code contains `#include \<stdio.h\>`, code contained within `stdio.h` somewhere on your computer is copied to your program. This step can be visualized as follows: 

        ...
        string get_string(string prompt);
        int printf(string format, ...);
        ...

        int main(void)
        {
            string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", name);
        }


* Second, _compiling_ is where your program is converted into assembly code. This step can be visualized as follows: ![compiling](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide033.png "compiling")
        
*   Third, _assembling_ involves the compiler converting your assembly code into machine code. This step can be visualized as follows: ![assembling](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide038.png "assembling")
        
*   Finally, during the _linking_ step, code from your included libraries are converted also into machine code and combined with your code. The final executable file is then outputted. ![linking](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Slide049.png "linking")
