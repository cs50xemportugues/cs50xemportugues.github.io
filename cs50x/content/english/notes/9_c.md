POST
----

*   You can imagine scenarios where it is not safe to utilize `get`, as usernames and passwords would show up in the URL.
*   We can utilize the method `post` to help with this problem by modifying `app.py` as follows:
    
        # Switches to POST
        
        from flask import Flask, render_template, request
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        
        @app.route("/")
        def index():
            return render_template("index.html")
        
        
        @app.route("/greet", methods=["POST"])
        def greet():
            return render_template("greet.html", name=request.form.get("name", "world"))
        
    
    Notice that `POST` is added to the `/greet` route, and that we use `request.form.get` rather than `request.args.get`.
    
*   This tells the server to look _deeper_ in the virtual envelope and not reveal the items in `post` in the URL.
*   Still, this code can be advanced further by utilizing a single route for both `get` and `post`. To do this, modify `app.py` as follows:
    
        # Uses a single route
        
        from flask import Flask, render_template, request
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        
        @app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
        def index():
            if request.method == "POST":
                return render_template("greet.html", name=request.form.get("name", "world"))
            return render_template("index.html")
        
    
    Notice that both `get` and `post` are done in a single routing. However, `request.method` is utilized to properly route based upon the type of routing requested by the user.
    

Frosh IMs
---------

*   Frosh IMs or _froshims_ is a web application that allows students to register for intermural sports.
*   Create a folder by typing `mkdir froshims` in the terminal window. Then, type `cd froshims` to browse to this folder. Within, create a directory called templates by typing `mkdir templates`. Finally, type `code app.py` and write code as follows:
    
        # Implements a registration form using a select menu
        
        from flask import Flask, render_template, request
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        SPORTS = [
            "Basketball",
            "Soccer",
            "Ultimate Frisbee"
        ]
        
        
        @app.route("/")
        def index():
            return render_template("index.html", sports=SPORTS)
        
        
        @app.route("/register", methods=["POST"])
        def register():
        
            # Validate submission
            if not request.form.get("name") or request.form.get("sport") not in SPORTS:
                return render_template("failure.html")
        
            # Confirm registration
            return render_template("success.html")
        
    
    Notice that a `failure` option is provided, such that a failure message will be displayed to the user if the `name` or `sport` field is not properly filled out.
