Valgrind
--------

*   _Valgrind_ is a tool that can check to see if there are memory-related issues with your programs wherein you utilized `malloc`. Specifically, it checks to see if you `free` all the memory you allocated.
*   Consider the following code:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int *x = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
            x[0] = 72;
            x[1] = 73;
            x[2] = 33;
        }
        
    
    Notice that running this program does not cause any errors. While `malloc` is used to allocate enough memory for an array, the code fails to `free` that allocated memory.
    
*   If you type `make memory` followed by `valgrind ./memory`, you will get a report from valgrind that will report where memory has been lost as a result of your program.
*   You can modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int *x = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
            x[0] = 72;
            x[1] = 73;
            x[2] = 33;
            free(x);
        }
        
    
    Notice that running valgrind again now results in now memory leaks.
    

Garbage Values
--------------

*   When you ask the compiler for a block of memory, there is no guarantee that this memory will be empty.
*   It’s very possible that this memory that you allocated was previously utilized by the computer. Accordingly, you may see _junk_ or _garbage values_. This is a result of you getting a block of memory but not initializing it. For example, consider the following code:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int scores[1024];
            for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++)
            {
                printf("%i\n", scores[i]);
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that running this code will allocate `1024` locations in memory for your array, but the `for` loop will likely show that not all values therein are `0`. It’s always best practice to be aware of the potential for garbage values when you do not initialize blocks of memory to some other value like zero or otherwise.
    

Pointer Fun with Binky
----------------------

*   We watched a [video from Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VnDaHBi8dM) that helped us visualize and understand pointers.

Swap
----

*   In the real world, a common need in programming is to swap two values. Naturally, it’s hard to swap two variables without a temporary holding space. In practice, you can type `code swap.c` and write code as follows to see this in action:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        void swap(int a, int b);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int x = 1;
            int y = 2;
        
            printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
            swap(x, y);
            printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
        }
        
        void swap(int a, int b)
        {
            int tmp = a;
            a = b;
            b = tmp;
        }
        
    
    Notice that while this code runs, it does not work. The values, even after being sent to the `swap` function, do not swap. Why?
    
*   When you pass values to a function, you are only providing copies. In previous weeks, we discussed the concept of _scope_. The values of `x` and `y` created in the curly `{}` braces of the `main` function only have the scope of the `main` function. Consider the following image:
    
    ![a rectangle with machine code at top followed by globals heap and stack](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide163.png "stack and heap")
    
    Notice that _global_ variables, which we have not used in this course, live in one place in memory. Various functions are stored in the `stack` in another area of memory.
    
*   Now, consider the following image:
    
    ![a rectangle with main function at bottom and swap function directly above it](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide167.png "frames")
    
    Notice that `main` and `swap` have two separate _frames_ or areas of memory. Therefore, we cannot simply pass the values from one function to another to change them.
    
*   Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        void swap(int *a, int *b);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int x = 1;
            int y = 2;
        
            printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
            swap(&x, &y);
            printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
        }
        
        void swap(int *a, int *b)
        {
            int tmp = *a;
            *a = *b;
            *b = tmp;
        }
        
    
    Notice that variables are not passed by _value_ but by _reference_. That is, the addresses of `a` and `b` are provided to the function. Therefore, the `swap` function can know where to make changes to the actual `a` and `b` from the main function.
    
*   You can visualize this as follows:
    
    ![a and b stored in main function being passed by reference to the swap function](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/4/cs50Week4Slide173.png "swap by reference")
