Welcome!
--------

*   In previous weeks, you were introduced to the fundamental building blocks of programming.
*   You learned about programming in a lower-level programming language called C.
*   Today, we are going to work with a higher-level programming language called _Python_.
*   As you learn this new language, you’re going to find that you are going to be more able to teach yourself new programming languages.

Python
------

*   Humans, over the decades, have seen how previous design decisions could be improved upon.
*   Python is a programming language that builds upon what you have already learned in C.

Hello
-----

*   Up until this point, the code has looked like this:
    
        // A program that says hello to the world
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");
        }
        
    
*   Today, you’ll find that the process of writing and compiling code has been simplified.
*   For example, the above code will be rendered in Python as:
    
        # A program that says hello to the world
        
        print("hello, world")
        
    
    Notice that the semicolon is gone.
    
*   In C, you might remember this code:
    
        // get_string and printf with %s
        
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
            printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
        }
        
    
*   This code is transformed in Python to:
    
        # get_string and print, with concatenation
        
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
        print("hello, " + answer)
        
    
    You can write this code by executing `code hello.py` in the terminal window. Then, you can execute this code by running `python hello.py`. Notice how the `+` sign concatenates `"hello, "` and `answer`.
    
*   Similarly, you could implement the above code as:
    
        # get_string and print, with format strings
        
        from cs50 import get_string
        
        answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
        print(f"hello, {answer}")
        
    
    Notice how the curly braces allow for the `print` function to interpolate the `answer` such that `answer` appears within.
