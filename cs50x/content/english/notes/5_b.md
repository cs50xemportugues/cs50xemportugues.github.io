Resizing Arrays
---------------

*   Rewinding to Week 2, we introduced you to your first data structure.
*   An array is a block of contiguous memory.
*   You might imagine an array as follows:
    
    ![three boxes with 1 2 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide019.png "array")
    
*   In memory, there are other values being stored by other programs, functions, and variables. Many of these may be unused garbage values that were utilized at one point but are available now for use.
    
    ![three boxes with 1 2 3 among lots of other memory elements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide022.png "array inside memory")
    
*   Imagine you wanted to store a fourth value `4` in our array? What would be needed is to allocate a new area of memory and move the old array to a new one.
    
    ![Three boxes with 1 2 3 above four boxes with 1 2 and two garbage values](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide025.png "two arrays with garbage values")
    
*   Old garbage values would be overwritten with our new data.

*   One of the drawbacks of this approach is that it’s bad design: Every time we add a number, we have to copy the array item by item.
    
*   Wouldn’t it be nice if we were able to put the `4` somewhere else in memory? By definition, this would no longer be an array because `4` would no longer be in contiguous memory.
    
*   In your terminal, type `code list.c` and write code as follows:
    
        // Implements a list of numbers with an array of fixed size
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // List of size 3
            int list[3];
        
            // Initialize list with numbers
            list[0] = 1;
            list[1] = 2;
            list[2] = 3;
        
            // Print list
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                printf("%i\n", list[i]);
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that the above is very much like what we learned earlier in this course. We have memory being preallocated for three items.
    
*   Building upon our knowledge obtained more recently, we can leverage our understanding of pointers to create a better design in this code. Modify your code as follows:
    
        // Implements a list of numbers with an array of dynamic size
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // List of size 3
            int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
            if (list == NULL)
            {
                return 1;
            }
        
            // Initialize list of size 3 with numbers
            list[0] = 1;
            list[1] = 2;
            list[2] = 3;
        
            // List of size 4
            int *tmp = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
            if (tmp == NULL)
            {
                free(list);
                return 1;
            }
        
            // Copy list of size 3 into list of size 4
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                tmp[i] = list[i];
            }
        
            // Add number to list of size 4
            tmp[3] = 4;
        
            // Free list of size 3
            free(list);
        
            // Remember list of size 4
            list = tmp;
        
            // Print list
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {
                printf("%i\n", list[i]);
            }
        
            // Free list
            free(list);
            return 0;
        
    
    Notice that a list of size three integers is created. Then, three memory addresses can be assigned the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. Then, a list of size four is created. Next, the list is copied from the first to the second. The value for the `4` is added to the `tmp` list. Since the block of memory that `list` points to is no longer used, it is freed using the command `free(list)`. Finally, the compiler is told to point `list` pointer now to the block of memory that `tmp` points to. The contents of `list` are printed and then freed.
    
*   It’s useful to think about `list` and `tmp` as both signs that point at a chunk of memory. As in the example above, `list` at one point _pointed_ to an array of size 3. By the end, `list` was told to point to a chunk of memory of size 4. Technically, by the end of the above code, `tmp` and `list` both pointed to the same block of memory.
    
*   C comes with a very useful function called `realloc` that will reallocate the memory for you. `realloc` takes two arguments. First, it asks you to specify the array you are attempting to copy. Second, it asks you to specify the size to which you would like the final array to be. Modify your code as follows:
    
        // Implements a list of numbers with an array of dynamic size using realloc
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // List of size 3
            int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
            if (list == NULL)
            {
                return 1;
            }
        
            // Initialize list of size 3 with numbers
            list[0] = 1;
            list[1] = 2;
            list[2] = 3;
        
            // Resize list to be of size 4
            int *tmp = realloc(list, 4 * sizeof(int));
            if (tmp == NULL)
            {
                free(list);
                return 1;
            }
            list = tmp;
        
            // Add number to list
            list[3] = 4;
        
            // Print list
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {
                printf("%i\n", list[i]);
            }
        
            // Free list
            free(list);
            return 0;
        }
        
    
    Notice that `int *tmp = realloc(list, 4 * sizeof(int))` creates a list of size four integers. Then, it copies the values of `list` to this new array. Finally, a pointer called `tmp` points to the location of memory of this new array. The copying is handled by `realloc`. Once that copy is made, the memory at the location of `list` is freed. Then, the pointer called `list` is pointed at the location of `tmp`, where the new array is located.
    
*   You can imagine how using `realloc` for a queue or stack could be useful. As the amount of data grows, `realloc` could be used to grow or shrink the stack or queue.
