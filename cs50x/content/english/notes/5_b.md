Data structures
---------------

*   **Data structures** are programming constructs that allow us to store information in different layouts in our computer’s memory.
*   To build a data structure, we’ll need some tools we’ve seen:
    *   `struct` to create custom data types
    *   `.` to access properties in a structure
    *   `*` to go to an address in memory pointed to by a pointer

Linked Lists
------------

*   With a **linked list**, we can store a list of values that can easily be grown by storing values in different parts of memory:  
    ![grid representing memory, with three of the boxes labeled with empty boxes between them, each labeled 1 0x123, 2 0x456, and 3 0x789](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/linked_list.png)
    *   This is different than an array since our values are no longer next to one another in memory.
*   We can link our list together by allocating, for each element, enough memory for both the value we want to store, and the address of the next element:  
    ![three boxes, each divided in two and labeled (1 0x123 and 0x456), (2 0x456 and 0x789), and (3 0x789 and NULL)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/linked_list_with_addresses.png)
    *   By the way, `NUL` refers to `\0`, a character that ends a string, and `NULL` refers to an address of all zeros, or a null pointer that we can think of as pointing nowhere.
*   Unlike we can with arrays, we no longer randomly access elements in a linked list. For example, we can no longer access the 5th element of the list by calculating where it is, in constant time. (Since we know arrays store elements back-to-back, we can add 1, or 4, or the size of our element, to calculate addresses.) Instead, we have to follow each element’s pointer, one at a time. And we need to allocate twice as much memory as we needed before for each element.
*   In code, we might create our own struct called `node` (like a node from a graph in mathematics), and we need to store both an `int` and a pointer to the next `node` called `next`:
    
        typedef struct node
        {
            int number;
            struct node *next;
        }
        node;
        
    
    *   We start this struct with `typedef struct node` so that we can refer to a `node` inside our struct.
*   We can build a linked list in code starting with our struct. First, we’ll want to remember an empty list, so we can use the null pointer: `node *list = NULL;`.
*   To add an element, first we’ll need to allocate some memory for a node, and set its values:
    
        node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
        // We want to make sure malloc succeeded in getting memory for us:
        if (n != NULL)
        {
            // This is equivalent to (*n).number, where we first go to the node pointed
            // to by n, and then set the number property. In C, we can also use this
            // arrow notation:
            n->number = 2;
            // Then we need to store a pointer to the next node in our list, but the
            // new node won't point to anything (for now):
            n->next = NULL;
        }
        
    
*   Now our list can point to this node: `list = n;`:  
    ![a box labeled list with arrow outwards pointing to two connected boxes, one with 2 and one empty)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/list_with_one_node.png)
*   To add to the list, we’ll create a new node the same way, perhaps with the value 4. But now we need to update the pointer in our first node to point to it.
*   Since our `list` pointer points only to the first node (and we can’t be sure that the list only has one node), we need to “follow the breadcrumbs” and follow each node’s next pointer:
    
        // Create temporary pointer to what list is pointing to
        node *tmp = list;
        // As long as the node has a next pointer ...
        while (tmp->next != NULL)
        {
            // ... set the temporary to the next node
            tmp = tmp->next;
        }
        // Now, tmp points to the last node in our list, and we can update its next
        // pointer to point to our new node.
        
    
*   If we want to insert a node to the front of our linked list, we would need to carefully update our node to point to the one following it, before updating list. Otherwise, we’ll lose the rest of our list:
    
        // Here, we're inserting a node into the front of the list, so we want its
        // next pointer to point to the original list, before pointing the list to
        // n:
        n->next = list;
        list = n;
        
    
*   And to insert a node in the middle of our list, we can go through the list, following each element one at a time, comparing its values, and changing the `next` pointers carefully as well.
*   With some volunteers on the stage, we simulate a list, with each volunteer acting as the `list` variable or a node. As we insert nodes into the list, we need a temporary pointer to follow the list, and make sure we don’t lose any parts of our list. Our linked list only points to the first node in our list, so we can only look at one node at a time, but we can dynamically allocate more memory as we need to grow our list.
*   Now, even if our linked list is sorted, the running time of searching it will be _O_(_n_), since we have to follow each node to check their values, and we don’t know where the middle of our list will be.
*   We can combine all of our snippets of code into a complete program:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        
        // Represents a node
        typedef struct node
        {
            int number;
            struct node *next;
        }
        node;
        
        int main(void)
        {
            // List of size 0, initially not pointing to anything
            node *list = NULL;
        
            // Add number to list
            node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
            if (n == NULL)
            {
                return 1;
            }
            n->number = 1;
            n->next = NULL;
            // We create our first node, store the value 1 in it, and leave the next
            // pointer to point to nothing. Then, our list variable can point to it.
            list = n;
        
            // Add number to list
            n = malloc(sizeof(node));
            if (n == NULL)
            {
                return 1;
            }
            n->number = 2;
            n->next = NULL;
            // Now, we go our first node that list points to, and sets the next pointer
            // on it to point to our new node, adding it to the end of the list:
            list->next = n;
        
            // Add number to list
            n = malloc(sizeof(node));
            if (n == NULL)
            {
                return 1;
            }
            n->number = 3;
            n->next = NULL;
            // We can follow multiple nodes with this syntax, using the next pointer
            // over and over, to add our third new node to the end of the list:
            list->next->next = n;
            // Normally, though, we would want a loop and a temporary variable to add
            // a new node to our list.
        
            // Print list
            // Here we can iterate over all the nodes in our list with a temporary
            // variable. First, we have a temporary pointer, tmp, that points to the
            // list. Then, our condition for continuing is that tmp is not NULL, and
            // finally, we update tmp to the next pointer of itself.
            for (node *tmp = list; tmp != NULL; tmp = tmp->next)
            {
                // Within the node, we'll just print the number stored:
                printf("%i\n", tmp->number);
            }
        
            // Free list
            // Since we're freeing each node as we go along, we'll use a while loop
            // and follow each node's next pointer before freeing it, but we'll see
            // this in more detail in Problem Set 5.
            while (list != NULL)
            {
                node *tmp = list->next;
                free(list);
                list = tmp;
            }
        }
