Types, formats, operators
-------------------------

*   There are other types we can use for our variables
    *   `bool`, a Boolean expression of either `true` or `false`
    *   `char`, a single character like `a` or `2`
    *   `double`, a floating-point value with even more digits
    *   `float`, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
    *   `int`, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
    *   `long`, integers with more bits, so they can count higher
    *   `string`, a string of characters
*   And the CS50 library has corresponding functions to get input of various types:
    *   `get_char`
    *   `get_double`
    *   `get_float`
    *   `get_int`
    *   `get_long`
    *   `get_string`
*   For `printf`, too, there are different placeholders for each type:
    *   `%c` for chars
    *   `%f` for floats, doubles
    *   `%i` for ints
    *   `%li` for longs
    *   `%s` for strings
*   And there are some mathematical operators we can use:
    *   `+` for addition
    *   `-` for subtraction
    *   `*` for multiplication
    *   `/` for division
    *   `%` for remainder
