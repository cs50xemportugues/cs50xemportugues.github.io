*   Everything we’ve discussed today has focused on various building-blocks of your work as a programmer.
*   The following will help you orient toward working on a problem set for this class in general: How does one approach a computer science related problem?
*   Imagine we wanted to emulate the visual of the game Super Mario Bros. Considering the four question-blocks pictured, how could we create code that roughly represents these four horizontal blocks?

*   In the terminal window, type `code mario.c` and code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {
                printf("?");
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
        
    
    Notice how four question marks are printed here using a loop.
    
*   Similarly, we can apply this same logic to be able to create three vertical blocks.
    
    ![Mario Blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/1/cs50Week1Slide125.png "Mario Blocks")
    
*   To accomplish this, modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice how three vertical bricks are printed using a loop.
    
*   What if we wanted to combine these ideas to create a three-by-three group of blocks?
    
    ![Mario Grid](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/1/cs50Week1Slide127.png "Mario Grid")
    
*   We can follow the logic above, combining the same ideas. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
                {
                    printf("#");
                }
                printf("\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that one loop is inside another. The first loop defines what vertical row is being printed. For each row, three columns are printed. After each row, a new line is printed.
    
*   What if we wanted to ensure that the number of blocks to be _constant_, that is, unchangeable? Modify your code as follows:
    
        int main(void)
        {
            const int n = 3;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                {
                    printf("#");
                }
                printf("\n");
            }
        
    
    Notice how `n` is now a constant. It can never be changed.
    
*   As illustrated earlier in this lecture, we can make our code prompt the user for the size of the grid. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n = get_int("Size: ");
        
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                {
                    printf("#");
                }
                printf("\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice that `get_int` is used to prompt the user.
    
*   A general piece of advice within programming is that you should never fully trust your user. They will likely misbehave, typing incorrect values where they should not. We can protect our program from bad behavior by checking to make sure the user’s input satisfies our needs. Modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Size: ");
            }
            while (n < 1);
        
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                {
                    printf("#");
                }
                printf("\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice how the user is continuously prompted for the size until the user’s input is 1 or greater.
