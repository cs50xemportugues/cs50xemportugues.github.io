       

Debugging
---------

*   Everyone will make mistakes while coding.
*   Consider the following image from last week:

*   Further, consider the following code that has a bug purposely inserted within it:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
            {
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   Type `code buggy0.c` into the terminal window and write the above code.
*   Running this code, four bricks appear instead of the intended three.
*   `printf` is a very useful way of debugging your code. You could modify your code as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
            {
                printf("i is %i\n", i);
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
*   Running this code, you will see numerous statements, including `i is 0`, `i is 1`, `i is 2`, and `i is 3`. Seeing this, you might realize that Further code needs to be corrected as follows:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }
        
    
    Notice the `<=` has been replaced with `<`.
    
*   A second tool in debugging is called a _debugger_, a software tool created by programmers to help track down bugs in code.
*   In VS Code, a preconfigured debugger has been provided to you.
*   To utilize this debugger, first set a _breakpoint_ by clicking to the left of a line of your code, just to the left of the line number. When you click there, you will see a red dot appearing. Imagine this as a stop sign, asking the compiler to pause such that you can consider what’s happening in this part of your code.
    
    ![break point](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/2/cs50Week2Debugging.png "break point")
    
*   Second, run `debug50 ./buggy0`. You will notice that after the debugger comes to life that a line of your code will illuminate in a gold-like color. Quite literally, the code has _paused_ at this line of code. Notice in the top left corner how all local variables are being displayed, including `i`, which has a current value of `0`. At the top of your window, you can click the `step over` button and it will keep moving through your code. Notice how the value of `i` increases.
*   While this tool will not show you where your bug is, it will help you slow down and see how your code is running step by step.
    
*   To illustrate a third means of debugging, please start a new file by running `code buggy1.c` in your terminal window. Write your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int get_negative_int(void);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = get_negative_int();
            printf("%i\n", i);
        }
        
        // Prompt user for positive integer
        int get_negative_int(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Negative Integer: ");
            }
            while (n < 0);
            return n;
        }
        
    
    Notice `get_negative_int` is designed to get a negative integer from the user.
    
*   Running `make buggy1`, you’ll notice that it does not do as intended. It accepts positive integers and seems to ignore negative ones.
*   As before, set a breakpoint at a line of your code. Best to set a breakpoint at `int i = get_negative_int`. Now, run `debug50 buggy1`.
*   Unlike before, where you utilized the `step over` button at the top of the window, use the `step into` button. This will take the debugger into your `get_negative_int` function. Notice how doing this will show you that you are, indeed, stuck in the `do while` loop.
*   With this knowledge, you might consider why you are stuck in this loop, leading you to edit your code as follows:
    
        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        int get_negative_int(void);
        
        int main(void)
        {
            int i = get_negative_int();
            printf("%i\n", i);
        }
        
        // Prompt user for positive integer
        int get_negative_int(void)
        {
            int n;
            do
            {
                n = get_int("Negative Integer: ");
            }
            while (n >= 0);
            return n;
        }
        
    
    Notice `n < 0` has been changed.
    
*   A final form of debugging is called _rubber duck debugging_. When you are having challenges with your code, consider how speaking out loud to, quite literally, a rubber duck about the code problem. If you’d rather not talk to a small plastic duck, you are welcome to speak to a human near you! They need not understand how to program: Speaking with them is an opportunity for you to speak about your code.
