  <p>
    Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you
    may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce
    to another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on
    <a href="{{url_for('cs50x.honesty')}}">academic honesty</a>.

  <p>
    The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to
    be in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who
    have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their
    CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.
