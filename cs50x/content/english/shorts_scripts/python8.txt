So now we've seen a lot of examples of this. How to interpolate variables similar to printf where we would use percent substitution. In Python, we've seen this one quite a few times. There's also this one which would allow us to concatenate strings together. So here, I'm not doing any interprolation, but I'm plugging in the variable pie and the variable price, transforming it into a string, because everything else here is the string so I need to transform that number into a string to make this work correctly. So that's what the str function there does. But this again would work. So a whole cheese pizza costs dollars 9 turned into a string. You might see this, which is actually really similar to you from printf but it's deprecated in Python 3. So you don't really want to use it even though it might be more familiar to you because it's similar to printf. So you might see it, but try and avoid using it because it is deprecated.
