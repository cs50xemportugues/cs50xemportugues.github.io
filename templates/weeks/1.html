<h1 id="problem-set-1">Problem Set 1</h1>
<p>
  Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you
  may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to
  another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on
  <a href="../../syllabus/#academic-honesty">academic honesty</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to be
  in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have
  already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50
  Certificate permanently revoked.

      If you see any errors when compiling your code with <code>make</code>,
      focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as
      needed. If unsure what it means, try asking <code>help50</code> for help.
      For instance, if trying to compile <code>hello</code>, and
    </p>
    <pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">make hello</span>
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> yielding errors, <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">running</span>

    help50 make hello


instead!
